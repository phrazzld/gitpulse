# CI Failure Audit

## Overview

All CI checks have failed for PR #19 "Implement Atomic Design pattern and Storybook integration". This document provides a detailed analysis of each failure and recommended fixes based on the CI logs.

## Failed Checks

1. **Playwright E2E Tests** - Failed after 1m57s
2. **build-and-test** - Failed after 2s
3. **chromatic-deployment** - Failed after 28s
4. **storybook-a11y** - Failed after 1m1s

## Detailed Analysis

After examining the logs for each failed check, here's a detailed analysis of what went wrong and how to fix it:

### 1. Playwright E2E Tests

**Failure Reason**: The E2E tests are failing to run properly. While we don't have the complete logs for this job, the failure is likely due to:
- Missing authentication configuration
- Tests attempting to access resources that don't exist in the CI environment
- Environment variables not properly set up

**Recommended Fix**:
- Update the E2E tests to use mocking for authentication in CI environment
- Add environment variables for any needed credentials or configuration
- Implement conditional test execution for tests that require specific environments

### 2. build-and-test

**Failure Reason**: The logs show an error with actions/upload-artifact@v3:
```
##[error]Missing download info for actions/upload-artifact@v3
```
This indicates the workflow is referencing an outdated GitHub action.

**Recommended Fix**:
- Update the action reference from `actions/upload-artifact@v3` to `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
- Check for other outdated actions and update them as well
- This aligns with one of the medium-priority items identified in our code review

### 3. chromatic-deployment

**Failure Reason**: The logs clearly show the issue:
```
14:46:12.018 âœ– Missing project token
```
The Chromatic workflow is failing because the CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN secret is not configured in the GitHub repository.

**Recommended Fix**:
- Create a Chromatic account and project at https://www.chromatic.com/start
- Get the project token from Chromatic
- Add the token as a repository secret named CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN
- Alternatively, make the workflow conditional on the presence of the token:
  ```yaml
  if: ${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN != '' }}
  ```

### 4. storybook-a11y

**Failure Reason**: The logs show the failure occurs when trying to run the Storybook CLI:
```
sh: 1: @storybook/cli@8.6.12: not found
```
This is due to an issue with the global installation of the Storybook CLI.

**Recommended Fix**:
- Remove the `npm install -g @storybook/cli` step as identified in our code review
- Replace with npx usage: `npx storybook test ...` or add as a dev dependency
- Update the workflow to:
  ```yaml
  - name: Run Storybook A11y checks
    run: npx storybook test --url=file://...
  ```

## Next Steps

1. **Priority Fixes**:
   - Add the CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN to GitHub repository secrets
   - Update GitHub Actions to v4 (addresses both build-and-test and one of our code review items)
   - Fix the Storybook A11y workflow to use npx instead of global installation

2. **Subsequent Improvements**:
   - Configure mock authentication for E2E tests
   - Make the Chromatic workflow conditional if token setup is delayed
   - Implement the other improvements identified in the code review to address workflow inconsistencies

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update CHROMATIC_SETUP.md to include instructions for setting up the project token
   - Add a section on CI configuration to the project documentation

These changes should address the immediate CI failures and implement several of the improvements identified in our code review.

## Additional Considerations

- **CI Environment Differences**: Remember that the CI environment may be different from local development
- **Secrets Management**: Ensure all required secrets and tokens are properly configured in GitHub
- **Selective Testing**: Consider temporarily disabling some tests until the environment is fully configured

After implementing the fixes, re-run the CI checks to verify that all issues are resolved.
