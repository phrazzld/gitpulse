# CI Failure Analysis for PR #12 - Layout Navigation Redesign

## Issue Summary

The CI build is failing in the "Code Quality Checks" step due to failing tests. There are 4 failed tests, all related to the `useActivityData` hook functionality in the `src/hooks/__tests__/useActivityData.test.ts` file.

## Failure Details

### 1. useActivityData › should handle load more correctly

```
expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

Expected: true
Received: false

  111 | // Verify first page loaded
  112 | expect(result.current.commits).toEqual(firstPageData.data);
> 113 | expect(result.current.hasMore).toBe(true);
      |                                    ^
  114 |
  115 | // Load next page
  116 | await act(async () => {
```

The test expects `result.current.hasMore` to be `true` but it's `false`.

### 2. useActivityData › should handle error states correctly

```
expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

Expected: "API error occurred"
Received: null

  150 | // Verify error state
  151 | expect(result.current.loading).toBe(false);
> 152 | expect(result.current.error).toBe(errorMessage);
      |                                  ^
  153 | expect(result.current.commits).toEqual([]);
  154 | });
  155 |
```

The test expects `result.current.error` to be the error message "API error occurred" but it's `null`.

### 3. useActivityData › should reset state when dependencies change

```
expect(jest.fn()).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(expected)

Expected number of calls: 2
Received number of calls: 79

  183 |
  184 | // Mock function should be called again with new params
> 185 | expect(mockFetcherFn).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
      |                           ^
  186 | });
  187 |
  188 | it("should apply correct filters to API request", async () => {
```

The test expects `mockFetcherFn` to have been called exactly 2 times, but it was called 79 times.

### 4. useActivityData › should reset data when calling reset method

```
expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

Expected: false
Received: true

  235 | // State should be reset
  236 | expect(result.current.commits).toEqual([]);
> 237 | expect(result.current.loading).toBe(false);
      |                                    ^
  238 | expect(result.current.hasMore).toBe(true);
  239 | });
  240 | });
```

The test expects `result.current.loading` to be `false` but it's `true`.

## Root Causes

After analyzing the test failures, I can identify the following potential root causes:

1. **State Management Changes**: The implementation of the `useActivityData` hook may have changed how it manages state properties like `hasMore`, `loading`, and `error`, causing test expectations to fail.

2. **Asynchronous Operation Timing**: The tests may be checking state values before asynchronous operations have completed, especially in the "reset" test where `loading` is still `true`.

3. **Mock Function Issues**: There's a major discrepancy in the number of times `mockFetcherFn` is being called (79 vs expected 2), suggesting either a loop in the implementation or an issue with the test setup.

4. **Error Handling Changes**: The error handling logic in `useActivityData` may have changed how errors are stored or processed, causing the error test to fail.

## Changes Required

To fix these issues, we need to:

1. **Audit the `useActivityData` Implementation**: Review the current implementation of the hook and compare it with what the tests expect.

2. **Update Test or Implementation**: Depending on intended behavior, either update the tests to match the new implementation or fix the implementation to match the expected behavior.

3. **Fix Infinite Loop Issue**: Identify and fix whatever is causing the fetcher function to be called 79 times.

4. **Adjust Asynchronous Testing**: Ensure tests properly wait for all state updates to complete before making assertions.

## Implementation Plan

1. First, we need to examine the `useActivityData.ts` file and understand its current implementation.
2. Review the recent changes to this file that might have affected the behavior.
3. Fix the implementation issues or update the tests to match the expected behavior.
4. Add proper async handling in tests to ensure state is stable before assertions.

## Recommended Fixes

### For the "hasMore" Issue:

- Check how the `hasMore` property is being set in the hook
- Ensure it's properly updated when the first page of data is loaded

### For the Error Handling Issue:

- Review how errors are captured and stored in the hook's state
- Ensure error messages are properly passed to the state

### For the Mock Function Call Issue:

- Look for dependency loops or improper dependency arrays in useEffect calls
- Ensure the mock function is properly reset between test cases

### For the Loading State Issue:

- Review the reset method implementation to ensure it properly resets the loading state
- Make sure tests wait for all state updates before making assertions

## Next Steps

1. Fix the identified issues in the `useActivityData` hook implementation
2. Update the tests if necessary to match the intended behavior
3. Run the tests locally to verify fixes before committing
4. Push the changes and ensure the CI checks pass

These failures appear to be related to changes in the `useActivityData` hook implementation that have caused inconsistencies with the test expectations. A careful review of both the hook code and the test cases is needed to align them properly.
