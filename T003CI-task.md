## Task ID
T003CI

## Title
Correct mocks and async handling in summary API handler tests

## Original Ticket Text
- Remove internal mocks from `src/app/api/summary/__tests__/handlers.test.ts`
- Mock only injected external dependencies
- Update assertions to focus on public behavior
- Ensure proper async/await usage and Promise handling
- **Depends on:** T002CI

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

Analyze this task following the implementation approach from the Development Philosophy:

1. **Core Principles:** Focus on simplicity, modularity, testability, and explicit dependencies
2. **Testing Strategy:** 
   - Mock ONLY external system boundaries (network, database, filesystem)
   - NEVER mock internal collaborators - refactor for testability instead
   - Test public behavior, not implementation details
3. **Error Handling:** Use consistent patterns with clear propagation
4. **Type Safety:** No `any` types, use proper TypeScript throughout
5. **Code Standards:** Follow ESLint rules, proper async/await patterns

### Current Situation
The handler tests likely contain mocks for internal modules after the T002CI refactoring that introduced dependency injection to the summary API handlers.

### Required Changes
1. Remove any remaining internal module mocks
2. Mock only the injected external dependencies
3. Update test assertions to verify public behavior
4. Fix any async/await patterns that aren't properly handled
5. Ensure all promises are resolved/rejected correctly

### Success Criteria
- Tests pass without internal mocks
- Only external dependencies are mocked (fetch, octokit)
- Proper async/await patterns used throughout
- Tests verify behavior, not implementation
- All TypeScript and ESLint checks pass
