# Add TSDoc to Auth Module - Task Plan

## Task ID
Add TSDoc to Auth Module

## Brief Approach
1. Review the existing `src/lib/auth/githubAuth.ts` file to identify all exported functions, types, and interfaces
2. Analyze the current TSDoc comments and identify what needs to be improved or added
3. Add comprehensive TSDoc comments following TypeScript documentation standards
4. Ensure documentation includes:
   - Clear descriptions of what each function/type does
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Return value descriptions
   - Exceptions/errors that can be thrown
   - Examples where helpful
5. Maintain consistency with existing documentation style
6. Run lint checks to ensure documentation meets standards

## Current Assessment
After reviewing the file, I see that:

1. The file already has some TSDoc comments for exported items
2. The following items need documentation improvement or addition:
   - File-level documentation
   - GitHubCredentials type (existing but can be improved)
   - AppInstallation interface (minimal existing)
   - createAuthenticatedOctokit function (good existing)
   - getInstallationManagementUrl function (basic existing)
   - getAllAppInstallations function (good existing)
   - checkAppInstallation function (good existing)

The documentation is generally of good quality but needs some standardization and enhancement to be comprehensive across all exported items.
