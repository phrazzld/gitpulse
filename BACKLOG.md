# BACKLOG

- generate analysis button in analysis filters is confusing -- doesn't seem to do anything when clicked, copies state of generate summary button further down the page. should probably be axed?
- fix: available accounts / orgs management flows ui not always present
- due to all the noise in the form, generate summary button is not clear about what it's actually generating
- the whole summary / analysis of activity should be reimagined from the ground up -- what is the ideal content this would generate, from first principles? what is the most useful and insightful content we could produce from ai-analysis and generation using deep context from github?
- bug: tried generating summary for my activity over past 7 days, got some output but also got this error in commit activity section: `Failed to load activity data. Please try again.: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'message')`
- bug: tried generating summary for my activity over past 7 days and somehow got 8 active days returned? seems like that should not be possible
- commit classification ui is not ideal form -- probably better to show bar chart or pie chart or something more visual that shows the total number of each type of commit and what portion of total commits it represents
- temporal analysis is incomplete
- comprehensive analysis is not very comprehensive, too concise, unclear what projects it is referring to
- key achievements should more clearly indicate what projects the achievements took place in
