- Ensure the UI meets basic accessibility standards (e.g., keyboard navigation, color contrast).
- Build a "Daily Standup Prep" recap showing recent commits for developers.
- Create a "Sprint Reflection" report with commit trends and top active projects.
- Flag unusual activity (e.g., no commits in 3 days) as a basic risk alert.
- Track individual commit counts over time as a simple "Personal Growth" feature.
- Analyze PR review frequency to show basic team collaboration stats.
- Predict feature completion dates using commit rates and a simple formula.
- Summarize repository history and top contributors for an "Onboarding Accelerator" page.
- Add a "Custom Insight" form to set basic alerts (e.g., "Notify me if commits drop below 5/day").
- Award a "Commit Streak" badge for 5 consecutive days of commits.
- Design a simple plugin system with a sample plugin for a new stat.
- Send a Slack notification for new insights or alerts.
- Link GitHub commits to Jira tickets using basic ID matching.
- Split data fetching, analysis, and UI into separate code modules.
- Process insights in the background and email them daily.
- Fetch only new GitHub data since the last update to reduce API calls.
- Encrypt GitHub tokens in storage and transit.
- Limit data access to match GitHub permissions for each user.
- Check GDPR compliance for storing GitHub usernames and commit data.
- Add a "Demo Mode" with fake data to preview the dashboard.
- Write integration tests for data fetching and UI display.
- Enhance logging with performance metrics (e.g., API response times).
- Fine-tune the AI model for better commit analysis accuracy.
- Use D3.js to add a heatmap of commit activity by hour and day.
- Add end-to-end tests for the summary generation workflow.
- Collect GitHub issues and comments for broader activity tracking.
- Normalize feature names from PR titles in the entity recognition service.
- Aggregate activity across repositories into a unified timeline.
- Track seasonal commit trends (e.g., monthly patterns) in the temporal module.
- Add a specialized AI model for code quality scoring.
- Calculate code churn (added vs. removed lines) in the stats module.
- Assess technical debt using commit message keywords (e.g., "fix", "hack").
- Build a network graph of PR reviews and comments for collaboration insights.
- Make the UI fully responsive for mobile and desktop.
- Suggest skill growth areas based on commit types (e.g., "Try more refactors").
- Recommend process tweaks (e.g., "Speed up PR reviews") from collaboration data.
- Generate automated onboarding docs from repository summaries.
