# BACKLOG

- âœ… Strip this application down to the barebones MVP requirements
  - Just for individuals looking at their own activity
  - No org stuff, no "all contributors in this repo" stuff
- implement semantic versioning (ideally automatically managed somehow ... conventional commits?)
- Redesign to something more modern and clean and professional
  - Raw Tailwind, or shadcn
- Add proper landing page as unauthenticated home page
- run `glance` on precommit hook
