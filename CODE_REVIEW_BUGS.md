## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH RISK BUGS
### [Issue] - Potential Infinite Redirect Loop - HIGH
- **Location**: `src/hooks/useProtectedRoute.ts:29-30`
- **Bug Type**: logic-error
- **What Happens**: The new redirect loop prevention logic uses `parseInt` on a URL search parameter (`_redirects`). If this parameter is not a valid number (e.g., `_redirects=foo`), `parseInt` returns `NaN`. The check `if (redirectCount > 3)` will then evaluate to `false` (since `NaN > 3` is false), completely bypassing the loop protection mechanism.
- **Impact**: A user could get stuck in an infinite redirect loop if they land on a page with a malformed `_redirects` query parameter, causing the browser tab to become unresponsive.
- **Fix**: Add a check to ensure `redirectCount` is a valid number after parsing. Default to `0` if it's `NaN`.

```typescript
// src/hooks/useProtectedRoute.ts:30
const rawCount = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('_redirects');
let redirectCount = parseInt(rawCount || '0', 10);
if (isNaN(redirectCount)) {
  redirectCount = 0;
}
```

## üîç POTENTIAL ISSUES
### [Issue] - Theme Does Not Update on System Preference Change - MEDIUM
- **Location**: `src/components/theme-provider.tsx`
- **Concern**: The `ThemeProvider` correctly applies the system theme on initial load but does not listen for live changes. If a user has their theme set to "system" and then changes their OS from light to dark mode (or vice-versa) while the application is open, the app's theme will not update to match.
- **Conditions**: This occurs when `theme` is "system" and the user's OS-level theme preference changes.
- **Mitigation**: In the `ThemeProvider`, add a `useEffect` hook that registers a `change` event listener on `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` to reactively apply the correct theme class to the root element.

### [Issue] - Jest Config May Fail with New Dependencies - MEDIUM
- **Location**: `jest.config.react.js:34-36`
- **Concern**: The `transformIgnorePatterns` is configured to only allow `lucide-react` to be transformed from `node_modules`. However, many new dependencies from `shadcn/ui` (like `@radix-ui/*`) are also published as ES modules. If tests import components that use these dependencies, Jest will fail with a `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` because it's not transforming them.
- **Conditions**: When running Jest tests for any component that imports an untransformed ES module dependency from `node_modules`.
- **Mitigation**: Update the `transformIgnorePatterns` to include other known ESM dependencies or switch to a more permissive pattern.
```javascript
// jest.config.react.js:34
// Example of a more robust pattern
transformIgnorePatterns: [
  '/node_modules/(?!(lucide-react|@radix-ui|class-variance-authority|clsx)/)',
],
```

### [Issue] - Invalid Theme Value from LocalStorage Breaks Styling - MEDIUM
- **Location**: `src/components/theme-provider.tsx:28-31`
- **Concern**: The provider gets the theme from `localStorage` and does a blind type assertion: `(localStorage.getItem(storageKey) as Theme)`. If a user manually edits `localStorage` to an invalid value (e.g., "purple"), the `theme` state will become "purple". This will add an invalid class to the `<html>` tag, causing all theme-based CSS variables to fail and breaking the site's styling.
- **Conditions**: When the theme value in `localStorage` is corrupted or not one of "light", "dark", or "system".
- **Mitigation**: Validate the value retrieved from `localStorage` before setting it as the theme. If it's invalid, fall back to the `defaultTheme`.
```typescript
// src/components/theme-provider.tsx:28
const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState<Theme>(() => {
  if (typeof window === "undefined") {
    return defaultTheme;
  }
  const storedTheme = localStorage.getItem(storageKey) as Theme;
  // Validate the stored theme
  if (storedTheme === 'light' || storedTheme === 'dark' || storedTheme === 'system') {
    return storedTheme;
  }
  return defaultTheme;
});
```

## ‚úÖ SUMMARY
- Critical Issues: 0 (must fix before merge)
- High Risk Bugs: 1 (should fix)
- Potential Issues: 3 (consider fixing)

**Overall Risk Assessment: HIGH-RISK**

The PR is currently high-risk due to the flawed redirect loop protection. While the other issues are less severe, they point to correctness problems in the new theming and testing infrastructure. The redirect loop bug should be fixed before merging.
