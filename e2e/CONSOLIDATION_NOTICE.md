# Auth Test Consolidation Notice

As part of task T038 (Final Cleanup and Mark T026 Complete), we've reviewed the authentication-related test files in the e2e directory. We found several overlapping test files that were created during the development and testing of the mock authentication strategy.

## Files Consolidated:

1. `auth-test.ts` - A simple script to test global setup directly
2. `auth-setup.spec.ts` - Test for authentication from global setup
3. `auth-verification.spec.ts` - Verification for auth cookie configuration

All functionality from these files has been consolidated into the comprehensive `auth.spec.ts` file, which includes:

- Authentication cookie verification
- Protected route access testing
- Authentication persistence across navigation
- Authentication removal testing

The original files have been kept for historical reference, but they should no longer be maintained or used in CI. All future authentication testing should go into `auth.spec.ts`.
