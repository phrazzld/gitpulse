# E2E Test Browser Verification

This document summarizes the verification of E2E tests across all configured browsers using the mock authentication mechanism.

## Browser Support

The tests have been verified to run successfully on the following browsers:

1. **Chromium** - All tests pass
2. **Firefox** - All tests pass
3. **WebKit** - All tests pass

## Authentication Mechanism

The mock authentication system uses a cookie-based approach that works consistently across all browsers. Key components:

1. **Global Setup Script** (`e2e/config/globalSetup.ts`):
   - Creates a mock session cookie
   - Configures proper cookie attributes (httpOnly, path, etc.)
   - Saves authentication state to `storageState.json`

2. **Storage State Configuration** (`playwright.config.ts`):
   - Each browser project loads the shared `storageState.json`
   - This ensures all tests start with an authenticated state

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Tests run with `NODE_ENV=test` and `E2E_MOCK_AUTH_ENABLED=true`
   - The web server is configured with these environment variables

## Browser-Specific Considerations

While the tests now pass in all browsers, there are some browser-specific behaviors to be aware of:

1. **Cookie Persistence**: In some browsers (particularly Firefox and WebKit), cookies may be refreshed or modified during navigation. Tests have been updated to be resilient to these changes by:
   - Verifying authentication via API endpoints rather than direct cookie inspection after navigation
   - Focusing on authentication state rather than cookie persistence

2. **NextAuth Warnings**: Some JWT-related warnings and errors may appear in the console when using the mock authentication system. These are expected and don't affect the tests, as our custom mock auth endpoint correctly handles the base64-encoded session data.

## Test Suite Overview

The E2E test suite includes:

- Authentication state verification tests
- Authenticated API access tests
- Unauthenticated access restriction tests
- Basic page loading tests

All tests pass consistently across all configured browsers.

## Recommendations

1. Continue using the `storageState` mechanism for E2E tests requiring authentication
2. Consider adding more comprehensive E2E tests leveraging this authentication mechanism
3. When navigating between pages in tests, avoid relying on cookie persistence and instead verify authentication state through API endpoints or protected UI elements
