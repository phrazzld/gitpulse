# ActivityMode Type Relocation Verification Report

## Overview

This report documents the verification process for ensuring that the relocation of the ActivityMode type from `common.ts` to `activity.ts` did not cause any issues with typechecking or tests.

## Testing Steps

### 1. TypeScript Type Checking

Ran `npm run typecheck` to verify that there are no type errors related to the ActivityMode type relocation.

**Result:** Passed ✅

```
> gitpulse@0.1.0 typecheck
> tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck --project tsconfig.json
```

### 2. Test Suite Execution

Ran `npm run test` to verify that all tests pass correctly after the type relocation.

**Result:** Passed ✅ (165 tests passed, all test suites passed)

### 3. Linting

Ran `npm run lint` to ensure code style is consistent.

**Result:** Passed ✅

```
✔ No ESLint warnings or errors
```

### 4. Usage Validation

- Reviewed all files that use the ActivityMode type
- Confirmed that dashboard components (FilterControls, SummaryDisplay, etc.) now correctly import from activity.ts
- Verified that test files reference ActivityMode as string literals and don't require imports

## File Analysis

Files verified:

- src/app/dashboard/page.tsx - Imports ActivityMode from activity.ts
- src/components/dashboard/FilterControls.tsx - Imports ActivityMode from activity.ts
- src/components/dashboard/SummaryDisplay.tsx - Imports ActivityMode from activity.ts
- src/types/testing.ts - Uses ActivityMode as a string type, no import needed
- Test files - Use string literals for ActivityMode values, no imports needed

## Conclusion

The relocation of the ActivityMode type from common.ts to activity.ts has been successfully verified. All type checking, tests, and linting pass without any issues related to the type relocation.

This verification confirms that:

1. The type was successfully moved in task T027
2. All necessary imports were updated in task T028
3. The application continues to function correctly with the relocated type

No issues were found that require additional work or fixes.
