## Task ID
T009

## Title
Implement local pre-commit/push accessibility checks

## Original Ticket Text
```
- [ ] **T009: Implement local pre-commit/push accessibility checks**
  - Research tools like `axe-core` CLI for fast local accessibility validation
  - Integrate with git hooks to prevent committing/pushing accessibility issues
  - Document setup for the development team
```

## Implementation Approach Analysis

Analyze this task considering:

1. **Tool Selection**
   - Research available CLI tools for accessibility checking (axe-core, pa11y, etc.)
   - Compare performance, features, and integration ease
   - Consider compatibility with Storybook stories

2. **Git Hook Integration**
   - Decide on pre-commit vs pre-push (or both)
   - Consider performance impact on developer workflow
   - Ensure hooks work with our existing Husky setup

3. **Scope Definition**
   - What to check: only changed files, all stories, critical components?
   - Define failure criteria: critical violations only, or all violations?
   - Consider developer override options for exceptional cases

4. **Integration with Existing Setup**
   - Work with current Storybook accessibility configuration
   - Align with CI accessibility checks for consistency
   - Leverage existing test-runner.js configuration if possible

5. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Setup instructions for developers
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Configuration options and overrides

6. **Testing Strategy**
   - How to test the hook implementation
   - Ensure it catches real violations
   - Verify performance is acceptable

Please provide a comprehensive implementation plan that follows our development philosophy, particularly focusing on:
- Automation principles
- Developer workflow efficiency  
- Consistency with existing accessibility testing
- Clear documentation
