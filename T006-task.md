# T006: Implement ESLint rule or pre-commit hook for dateMock.ts enforcement

## Task ID: T006

## Title: Implement ESLint rule or pre-commit hook for `dateMock.ts` enforcement

## Original Ticket Text:
- **T006: Implement ESLint rule or pre-commit hook for `dateMock.ts` enforcement**
  - Create custom rule to flag direct manipulation of `global.Date` or `Date.now`
  - Ensure proper detection and suggestions for using `dateMock.ts` instead
  - Test the rule against known violation patterns

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt:

Analyze the following task and provide a comprehensive implementation approach that aligns with our Development Philosophy and best practices.

**Key Requirements:**
1. Create automation to enforce use of dateMock.ts utility over direct Date manipulation in tests
2. Consider both ESLint custom rule and pre-commit hook approaches
3. Must detect patterns like:
   - Direct manipulation of `global.Date`
   - Direct manipulation of `Date.now`
   - Other date-related mock patterns that should use dateMock.ts
4. Provide helpful suggestions when violations are detected
5. Test the implementation against known violation patterns

**Context:**
- This task arose from T002 where tests were manually manipulating dates
- We have a dateMock.ts utility that provides a clean way to mock dates
- The development philosophy emphasizes automation and tooling

**Constraints:**
- Solution should align with existing tooling (ESLint, pre-commit hooks)
- Should not create false positives for legitimate Date usage outside tests
- Must provide clear guidance to developers when violations are found
