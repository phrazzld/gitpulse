T017: Fix Type Errors in Test Files

## Analysis of the Issues

After reviewing the example test files, I've identified the following TypeScript errors:

1. **Missing Type Definitions in Mock Components**:
   - In AccountManagementPanel.test.tsx and SummaryDisplay.test.tsx, the mocked components lack proper types for their props.
   - For example, in AccountManagementPanel.test.tsx, the mocked AccountSelector props don't have type definitions.
   - In SummaryDisplay.test.tsx, the ActivityFeed mock lacks proper type definitions.

2. **Implicit 'any' Types in Test Utility Components**:
   - In error-handling.test.tsx, there are several mocked components that use 'any' type for their props.
   - The mockAuthErrorProps and mockComponentProps use Record<string, any>.

3. **Missing Type Definitions in Test Data**:
   - Some test data objects may not fully match the expected types defined in the actual components.

4. **Invalid Type Assertions**:
   - Some type assertions may be incorrect or missing proper type guards.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Fix Mock Components in AccountManagementPanel.test.tsx**:
   - Import the actual prop types from the AccountSelector component
   - Apply these types to the mocked component's props
   - Fix any assertions that rely on these types

2. **Fix Mock Components in SummaryDisplay.test.tsx**:
   - Import the prop types from ActivityFeed
   - Apply these types to the mocked component's props
   - Fix any type issues in the test data setup

3. **Fix Mock Components in error-handling.test.tsx**:
   - Replace Record<string, any> with properly typed interfaces
   - Import and use the component's actual prop types where available
   - Create appropriate interfaces for mocked components when needed

4. **Fix Other Test Files with Similar Issues**:
   - Apply the same pattern to fix other test files that have type errors
   - Ensure that all component props have proper type definitions

## Implementation Approach

1. For each test file:
   - First, identify all component mocks that lack proper type definitions
   - Import the actual component prop types from their source files
   - Apply these types to the mocked components
   - Fix any assertions or test data to match these types

2. For mock records currently using 'any':
   - Create proper interfaces that represent the expected shape
   - Replace Record<string, any> with these interfaces
   - Use union types when a component might receive different prop shapes

3. For test data:
   - Ensure that all test data objects conform to their expected types
   - Add explicit type annotations to ensure type safety

4. Avoid disabling TypeScript checks:
   - Rather than using @ts-ignore or any types, fix the underlying issues
   - This helps maintain long-term code quality and prevents future errors

## Additional Considerations

- The fixes will be minimally invasive, focusing only on resolving type errors
- Test behavior and assertions will remain unchanged
- The goal is to make the existing tests pass TypeScript's type checker without changing test functionality
