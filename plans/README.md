# GitPulse GitHub Service Module Refactoring

This project has been split into multiple implementable plans based on scope analysis. Each file represents a step in the decomposition of the monolithic github.ts file.

## Available Plans

- [PLAN-1.md](split_plans/PLAN-1.md): Foundation (Types & Utils)
- [PLAN-2.md](split_plans/PLAN-2.md): Authentication Module
- [PLAN-3.md](split_plans/PLAN-3.md): Repositories Module
- [Future] PLAN-4: Commits Module
- [Future] PLAN-5: Barrel File & Internal Structure
- [Future] PLAN-6: Update Consumers (Incremental)
- [Future] PLAN-7: Final Cleanup (Optional)

Each plan can be independently implemented, focusing on a specific aspect of the refactoring while maintaining backward compatibility. Plans should be implemented sequentially, as later plans build upon the foundations established in earlier ones.
