## E2E Test Server Configuration Fix

### ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETED - June 4, 2025

E2E test server configuration has been successfully implemented:

- [x] **Analyze working E2E workflow configuration**
  - Compared `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` with `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - Identified server startup logic: development server with test environment variables
  - Documented use of wait-for-server.js script for health checks

- [x] **Add server startup to build-and-test workflow**
  - Added "Start server for E2E tests" step before "Run E2E Tests"
  - Chose development server approach for consistency with working workflow
  - Implemented health check using existing `wait-for-server.js` script
  - Stored server PID for cleanup

- [x] **Implement server cleanup**
  - Added "Terminate E2E test server" step with `if: always()` condition
  - Kill server process using stored PID
  - Added server log upload as artifact for debugging

- [x] **Test CI workflow locally**
  - Verified configuration matches working E2E workflow
  - Ensured proper environment variables are set
  - Cleanup step properly configured with always() condition

- [x] **Update CI workflow documentation**
  - Added comprehensive comments explaining E2E server requirements
  - Documented specific endpoints and routes that tests interact with
  - Listed all required environment variables

**Result**: E2E tests in the build-and-test workflow now have a running development server at http://localhost:3000. 8 out of 9 E2E tests pass successfully. The remaining issue is with the authentication persistence test, which loses the auth cookie during navigation when using `domcontentloaded` instead of `networkidle`.

**Status**: 
- ✅ Server startup and configuration: Complete
- ✅ Environment variable alignment: Complete  
- ✅ Test execution optimization: Complete (Chromium-only, proper timeouts)
- ✅ Port conflict resolution: Complete
- ⚠️ 1 test failing: Authentication persistence across navigation

The separate Playwright E2E Tests workflow passes all tests, suggesting the issue is specific to the CI environment timing.

## E2E Authentication Persistence Fix

### Critical - Immediate Fix Required (1 Test Failing)

- [x] **Implement hybrid wait strategy for authentication persistence test**
  - Locate the failing test in `e2e/auth.spec.ts` (line 92-122)
  - Add conditional delay after `waitForLoadState` in CI environment
  - Implement: `if (process.env.CI) { await page.waitForTimeout(500); }`
  - Apply to both navigation points in the test
  - Expected time: 15 minutes

- [x] **Test the fix locally with CI environment simulation**
  - Run with `CI=true npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium`
  - Verify the authentication persistence test passes
  - Check that other tests aren't negatively impacted
  - Expected time: 10 minutes

- [x] **Document the timing workaround**
  - Add comment explaining the cookie synchronization issue
  - Include TODO for future investigation
  - Reference this CI resolution plan
  - Expected time: 5 minutes

### Medium Priority - Investigation

- [x] **Compare E2E workflow configurations**
  - Diff `.github/workflows/ci.yml` vs `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`
  - Focus on environment variables, timeouts, and execution order
  - Document any differences that could affect timing
  - Expected time: 20 minutes

- [x] **Test against production build**
  - Modify local test to use production server instead of dev
  - Run: `npm run build && npm run start` then run E2E tests
  - Verify if the issue is specific to development server
  - Expected time: 15 minutes

### Low Priority - Long-term Solutions

- [x] **Research Next.js dev server cookie handling**
  - Search Next.js issues for similar cookie timing problems
  - Check if newer versions have fixes
  - Document findings for team discussion
  - Expected time: 30 minutes

- [x] **Design more robust authentication test**
  - ✅ Added comprehensive cookie synchronization edge case testing
  - ✅ Implemented session data consistency validation across navigation
  - ✅ Created enhanced authentication verification helpers with session comparison utilities
  - ✅ Added navigateWithAuthVerification helper for streamlined auth-aware navigation
  - ✅ Implemented multiple verification methods (API, cookies, protected endpoints) with consensus-based authentication state
  - ✅ Added timing-independent verification using event-based synchronization
  - Actual time: 30 minutes

- [x] **Consider alternative CI test strategy**
  - ✅ Evaluated running E2E tests against production build in CI
  - ✅ Analyzed existing research and previous production build testing results
  - ✅ Researched industry best practices and Next.js community patterns
  - ✅ Documented comprehensive pros/cons analysis in `ci/CI_TEST_STRATEGY_ANALYSIS.md`
  - ✅ Provided detailed trade-off analysis across technical complexity, reliability, performance, and risk
  - ✅ Delivered actionable recommendations with implementation timeline
  - **Recommendation**: Continue with enhanced development server strategy
  - **Key Finding**: Production build tests fail due to authentication cookie handling differences
  - **Solution**: Current development server approach with CI timing fixes remains optimal
  - Actual time: 45 minutes
