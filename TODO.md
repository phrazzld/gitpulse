  ### Learnings
  - Used variant="outline" with custom colors for colored badges
  - Used variant="secondary" for neutral count badges

  - Completed: 2025-07-21 00:44
  
  ### Execution Log
  ### Complexity: MEDIUM
  ### Started: 2025-07-21 00:31
  
  ### Context Discovery
  - Searching for components that accept style/className props
  - Identifying which props are necessary vs legacy
  - ModeSelector.tsx already identified as having deprecated color props
  
  ### Approach Decisions
  - Keep className props that are actively used or useful for customization
  - Remove deprecated color props and unused className props
  - Maintain backward compatibility where reasonable
  
  ### Execution Log
  [00:32] Found components with style-related props:
    - ModeSelector: 5 deprecated color props (accentColor, secondaryColor, etc.)
    - SummaryDetails: className prop (not used by any parent)
    - SummaryStats: className prop (used by SummaryView with "mb-8")
    - LoadMoreButton: className prop (used by ActivityFeed with "mt-3")
    - AuthLoadingScreen: className prop (not used but useful for full-screen customization)
    
  [00:35] Removed deprecated color props from ModeSelector
    - Removed accentColor, secondaryColor, textColor, backgroundColor, selectedBackgroundColor
    - No components were using these deprecated props
    - Kept className prop for flexibility
    
  [00:38] Removed unused className from SummaryDetails
    - No parent components passing className
    - Component wasn't using it for any default styling
    
  [00:40] Attempted to remove className from LoadMoreButton
    - Found ActivityFeed was using it with className="mt-3"
    - Restored className prop to LoadMoreButton
    - Removed className="mt-3" from ActivityFeed instead
    
  [00:42] Fixed ModeSelector.stories.tsx
    - Removed deprecated color prop definitions from argTypes
    - Removed CustomTheme story that used deprecated props
    - TypeScript compilation successful

  - ✓ Fixed LoadMoreButton usage in ActivityFeed
  - ✓ Kept className in LoadMoreButton (for flexibility)
  - ✓ Kept className in SummaryStats (actively used)

  ### Verification
  - Searched for deprecated color props in all TypeScript files
  - Checked for style/className in type definitions
  - Verified no type definition files contain removed props
  
  ### Results
  [00:45] Verification completed
  - ✓ NO references to accentColor, secondaryColor, textColor, backgroundColor, selectedBackgroundColor
  - ✓ NO style-related props in type definition files
  - ✓ All TypeScript types are already clean
  - ✓ Task was automatically completed by previous prop cleanup work
  
  ### Learnings
  - TypeScript types were inline with component props, so removing props automatically cleaned types
  - No separate type definition updates were needed
