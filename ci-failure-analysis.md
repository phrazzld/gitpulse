# CI Failure Analysis

## Summary

The CI build for branch `feat/layout-navigation-redesign` is failing due to test failures in the integration test suite. Specifically, the file `src/__tests__/integration/dashboard.test.tsx` contains failing tests.

## Failed Tests

The test failures are occurring in the `"handles form submission and displays summary"` test in the dashboard integration test file. This is one of the existing integration tests, not one of the new tests we created.

## Specific Errors

1. The test is failing at this assertion:

```typescript
expect(mockComponentProps.SummaryDisplay.summary).toEqual(mockSummary);
```

The test is expecting that the SummaryDisplay component receives the `mockSummary` object after form submission, but it seems that it's receiving a different value or no value at all.

## Analysis

The issue appears to be related to changes in how the form submission and data loading works in the updated Dashboard component. Our updates to the dashboard page and components have changed the way data flows through the components, causing the existing test expectations to fail.

The main problem is that the original test was set up assuming a specific implementation of the dashboard components. Our refactoring has changed these implementation details:

1. We've split the dashboard into multiple separate components (DashboardSummaryPanel, ActivityOverviewPanel, ActivityFeedPanel)
2. We've modified how data flows between components
3. The dashboard now uses panel expansion states and other new features

The original test was directly checking that `SummaryDisplay` receives the expected props, but our implementation no longer uses SummaryDisplay in the same way - we've replaced it with our new component structure.

## Proposed Fix

We need to update the existing dashboard integration test to accommodate our new component structure:

1. Update mock implementations of components to match the new component structure
2. Fix the assertion to check for data in the appropriate new components rather than the old SummaryDisplay
3. Ensure that test expectations match the actual component behavior

Alternatively, since we've created a new and more comprehensive integration test in `dashboard-integration.test.tsx`, we could consider either:

1. Updating the old test to be compatible with our changes, or
2. Deprecating the old test and relying on our new test file

## Next Steps

1. Update the existing dashboard.test.tsx file to be compatible with our updated dashboard components
2. Fix the test assertions to match the current implementation
3. Run the tests to verify they pass
4. Push the fixes to the branch
5. Re-run the CI

This will require making changes to the existing test file without affecting the functionality we've implemented.
