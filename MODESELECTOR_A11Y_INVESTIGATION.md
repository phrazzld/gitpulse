# ModeSelector Accessibility Violations Investigation

## Summary
ModeSelector components have systematic color contrast violations across all stories, with violations detected in both main component stories and accessibility-specific examples.

## Violation Details

### Type: color-contrast (WCAG 2 AA)
- **Impact**: Serious
- **Description**: Ensure the contrast between foreground and background colors meets WCAG 2 AA minimum contrast ratio thresholds

### Affected Stories

#### ModeSelector.stories.tsx
- Default story: 6 violations
- Work Mode Selected: 4 violations  
- Team Mode Selected: 4 violations
- Custom Modes: 4 violations
- Custom Theme: 3 violations
- Custom Label: 4 violations
- Disabled: **No violations** (passes)

#### ModeSelector.accessibility.stories.tsx
- Aria Label Example: 7 violations
- Keyboard Navigation Example: 4 violations
- Detailed Descriptions Example: 4 violations
- Visible Label Example: 4 violations
- State Announcement Example: 4 violations
- Disabled State Example: **No violations** (passes)

#### ui/ModeSelector.stories.tsx
- Default: 6 violations
- Work Mode Selected: 4 violations
- Team Mode Selected: 4 violations  
- Custom Modes: 4 violations
- Custom Theme: 3 violations
- Custom Label: 4 violations
- Disabled: **No violations** (passes)

## Pattern Analysis

1. **Consistent Pattern**: Most stories show 3-7 color contrast violations, indicating systemic issues with the component's color choices
2. **Disabled State**: Only the disabled state passes accessibility tests, likely because disabled elements have different contrast requirements
3. **Multiple Components**: Violations occur in both `/components/atoms/ModeSelector` and `/components/ui/ModeSelector` versions

## Root Causes

Based on the pattern, the violations are likely due to:
1. Text color not meeting 4.5:1 contrast ratio against backgrounds
2. Selected state indicators not meeting 3:1 contrast ratio
3. Description text having insufficient contrast

## Next Steps

The next task will be to:
1. Examine the ModeSelector component code to identify specific color values
2. Test current color combinations with the colorContrast utility
3. Update colors to use approved combinations from the design tokens
4. Ensure all text meets 4.5:1 and all UI elements meet 3:1 contrast ratios
