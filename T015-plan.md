# T015 Plan: Add Code Comments for Complex Dashboard Layout Decisions

## Task Summary
Add explanatory comments to clarify the rationale behind complex layout decisions in the dashboard's responsive grid configuration.

## Approach
1. Review the responsive grid configuration in:
   - `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
   - `src/components/dashboard/layout/DashboardGridContainer.tsx`

2. Identify complex layout decisions, focusing on:
   - Responsive breakpoint adjustments
   - Grid span configurations
   - Component positioning logic
   - Any non-obvious layout choices

3. Add clear, concise comments that explain WHY these decisions were made (not just what they do)
   - Focus on explaining rationale rather than describing implementation
   - Target comments at appropriate abstraction level
   - Use consistent comment style

4. Verify the comments provide meaningful insight for future developers

## Success Criteria
- All non-obvious layout choices have explanatory comments
- Comments focus on the "why" rather than the "how"
- Comments are concise and follow project conventions
