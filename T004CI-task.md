## Title
Fix "me" special case logic in summary API handlers

## Original Ticket Text
- Investigate and correct the "me" special case logic in handlers
- Update the corresponding test to assert correct behavior
- **Depends on:** T003CI

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

Analyze this task following the implementation approach from the Development Philosophy:

1. **Core Principles:** Focus on simplicity, modularity, testability, and explicit dependencies
2. **Testing Strategy:** Test-driven development, mock only external dependencies, test behavior not implementation
3. **Error Handling:** Use consistent patterns with clear propagation
4. **Type Safety:** No `any` types, use proper TypeScript throughout
5. **Code Standards:** Follow ESLint rules, proper async/await patterns

### Investigation Needed
1. Understand what the "me" special case is supposed to do
2. Identify where the logic is implemented 
3. Find what's wrong with the current implementation
4. Determine what the correct behavior should be
5. Update both the implementation and tests

### Success Criteria
- The "me" filter works correctly when used alone
- The "me" filter works correctly when combined with other contributors
- The logic correctly identifies the current user
- Tests verify all edge cases
- TypeScript and ESLint checks pass
