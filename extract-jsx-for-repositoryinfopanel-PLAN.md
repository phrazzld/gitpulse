# Extract JSX for RepositoryInfoPanel

## Implementation Approach
Identify and extract the repository information panel JSX from the dashboard page, including the toggle button and repository list/summary, move it to the RepositoryInfoPanel component, and update the dashboard page to use the new component. Ensure all styles and functionality are preserved.
