# TypeScript Issues in GitPulse

This document outlines current TypeScript issues in the GitPulse codebase that are preventing successful pre-commit hooks from running. These issues should be addressed as part of a separate task.

## Current Issues

Several TypeScript errors exist in test utilities and test files:

1. In `src/components/dashboard/__tests__/SummaryStats.test.tsx`:
   - Missing required properties in mock data: `repositories` and `dates`

2. In `src/lib/__tests__/dashboard-utils.test.ts`:
   - Spread argument type issues

3. In test utility files (`src/lib/tests/`):
   - Various type compatibility issues in mocks
   - Errors with generic types and parameter type compatibility
   - Issues with handling unknown types

## Impact

These TypeScript errors are preventing the pre-commit hooks from passing, even when making focused changes to individual test files. The errors appear to be in the test infrastructure rather than in the application code itself.

## Recommended Solution

A focused effort should be made to fix these TypeScript issues as a separate task. In the meantime, for critical fixes, the `--no-verify` flag may be used with proper documentation of the reason and a TODO item added to address the underlying TypeScript issues.

## Tasks for TypeScript Fix

1. Address typing issues in test utilities
2. Fix mock data to match expected interfaces
3. Address generic type handling in test utilities
4. Add proper type guards for unknown types
5. Update React component testing utilities to use correct types

This work should be tracked as a separate task in the TODO.md file.
