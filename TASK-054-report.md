# TASK-054: Refactor renderHookSafely to use RTL's native utilities

## Summary
This task involved refactoring the `renderHookSafely` function to leverage React Testing Library's native utilities more directly, making the code cleaner, more maintainable, and better aligned with RTL's recommended patterns while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Type Definitions
- Updated the type imports to use `RenderHookResult` directly from RTL
- Corrected the `SafeRenderHookResult` type to properly extend RTL's type
- Fixed a previous type issue where `r` was incorrectly used instead of `Result`
- Added proper type parameters to RTL's `renderHook` call

### 2. Enhanced Documentation
- Added stronger deprecation warnings for `waitForNextUpdate`
- Clarified the purpose of each utility method
- Added explanatory comments throughout the code for better maintainability

### 3. Simplified Implementation
- Made the code more concise and readable
- Enhanced error handling for better debugging
- Reorganized the implementation to more clearly show the intent

### 4. Improved waitFor Implementations
- Kept the wrapper around RTL's native `waitFor` to ensure proper act() wrapping
- Simplified the code by removing unnecessary complexity
- Enhanced the error handling to provide better context when tests fail

### 5. Streamlined renderAsyncHook
- Updated documentation and comments
- Fixed type definitions to match the refactored code

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Enhanced Type Safety**
   - More accurate type definitions help catch errors at compile time
   - Better alignment with RTL's type system

2. **Improved Developer Experience**
   - Clearer documentation about deprecated methods
   - Better error messages when tests fail

3. **Reduced Code Complexity**
   - More direct delegation to RTL's native utilities
   - Simplified implementation that's easier to maintain

4. **Better Test Stability**
   - More robust handling of different value types in comparison functions
   - Clearer error handling patterns

## Backward Compatibility
All existing tests continue to pass with the refactored utilities. The API signatures remain unchanged to ensure full backward compatibility, while providing clearer guidance on future migration paths.

## Next Steps
The next task could focus on updating tests to use RTL's native utilities directly, further reducing the dependency on our custom wrappers. This would be TASK-055 according to the TODO.md file.
