# TASK-062: Add E2E Testing to CI Workflow - Implementation Report

## Summary

This task involved adding Playwright end-to-end (E2E) testing to the CI workflow to ensure that E2E tests are run as part of the CI process and that the build fails if these tests fail.

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to the CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

1. **Added Playwright Browser Installation Step**
   - Used `npx playwright install --with-deps` to install all browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) required for E2E tests
   - This is a standard approach recommended by the Playwright team for CI environments

2. **Added E2E Test Execution Step**
   - Configured the workflow to run `npm run test:e2e` with appropriate environment variables
   - Set `CI=true` to enable CI-specific settings in the Playwright configuration
   - Set `E2E_MOCK_AUTH_ENABLED=true` for mock authentication during tests
   - Added comments explaining that this step will automatically fail if any E2E tests fail

3. **Added Test Artifact Collection**
   - Configured the workflow to upload the Playwright report directory as an artifact
   - Added a step to collect test results, screenshots, and other artifacts
   - Set the `if: always()` condition to ensure artifacts are uploaded even if tests fail
   - Set appropriate retention periods for artifacts

## Implementation Details

The implementation leverages the existing Playwright configuration in `playwright.config.ts`, which already had CI-specific settings:

- Longer timeouts in CI environments
- Retry logic for flaky tests (2 retries in CI)
- Trace collection in CI
- Video recording on first retry
- Disabling of `.only` tests in CI

The CI workflow now:
1. Installs all required Playwright browsers
2. Runs the E2E tests with the appropriate environment variables
3. Collects and uploads test results and artifacts

## Benefits

- **Early Detection of Integration Issues**: E2E tests catch issues that unit tests might miss, such as API integration problems or UI workflow failures
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Tests now verify the application at all levels (unit, integration, E2E)
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Test artifacts and reports are available for debugging failed tests
- **Compliance with Development Philosophy**: Adheres to the requirement for comprehensive testing in the CI pipeline

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ E2E tests run as part of the CI workflow
- ✅ CI fails if E2E tests fail
- ✅ Test results and artifacts are available for debugging
