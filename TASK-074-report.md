# TASK-074: Test and fix OperationsPanel accessibility

## Task Description
This task involved testing the OperationsPanel component for accessibility issues and fixing any identified problems. The focus was on ensuring proper color contrast to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards after child components had been fixed in previous tasks.

## Changes Made

### 1. TerminalHeader Component Updates
- Updated the status indicator to use the darker electric blue color (#0066cc) for better contrast
- Added accessibility comments explaining the changes
- Improved border color contrast by specifying the new blue color directly

### 2. ErrorAlert Component Updates
- Fixed button styling to use the darker electric blue color (#0066cc) for better contrast
- Ensured hover and focus states maintain proper contrast ratios
- Updated the interactive elements to maintain consistent color usage

### 3. AuthStatusBanner Component Updates
- Updated background color for the banner from rgba(59, 142, 234, 0.1) to rgba(0, 102, 204, 0.1) for better contrast
- Fixed text and border colors to use the darker blue (#0066cc)
- Ensured all instances of electric blue color were updated consistently

### 4. OperationsPanel Component Updates
- Improved box shadow opacity for better visibility (from 0.15 to 0.2)
- Ensured the OperationsPanel component worked properly with the updated child components

## Testing
- Ran linting with `npm run lint` - Passed with no issues
- Ran TypeScript type checking with `npm run typecheck` - Passed with no issues
- Visually verified the changes maintain the design intent while improving accessibility

## Impact
These changes improve the accessibility of the OperationsPanel and its child components, specifically:
- Better contrast ratios for text and UI elements
- More consistent color usage across components
- Improved visibility for users with visual impairments
- Maintained the visual design aesthetics while improving accessibility

## Accessibility Standards
All changes were made to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards, which require:
- Text contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1
- UI controls contrast ratio of at least 3:1
- Focus indicators that are clearly visible

## Dependencies
This task built on previous accessibility fixes in:
- TASK-071: Button component
- TASK-072: LoadMoreButton component
- TASK-073: ModeSelector component

## Next Steps
TASK-075: Implement centralized color contrast utility
