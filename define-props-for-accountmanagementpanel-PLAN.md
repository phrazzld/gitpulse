# Define Props for AccountManagementPanel

## Implementation Approach
Review the AccountManagementPanel component to identify all state variables and functions needed, verify that the Props interface is defined correctly, and ensure proper typing of all props. The required props include authMethod, installations, currentInstallations, loading, getGitHubAppInstallUrl, getInstallationManagementUrl, switchInstallations, and session.
