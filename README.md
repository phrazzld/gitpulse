- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended)

## Architecture

GitPulse follows a **Functional Core / Imperative Shell** architecture with emphasis on testability, reliability, and maintainability.

### Core Architecture Principles

- **Functional Core**: Pure business logic with no side effects in `src/core/`
- **Imperative Shell**: I/O and side effects isolated to React hooks and API routes  
- **Pure Function Testing**: No mocks needed - test with input/output verification
- **Effect-Based Services**: Deferred computation for composable and testable workflows
- **TypeScript First**: Strong typing with readonly data structures throughout
- **Immutable by Default**: All data transformations preserve original data
- **Composable Logic**: Functions built using functional composition patterns

### Error Handling Strategy

GitPulse implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

1. **API Level**: Structured error responses with appropriate status codes
2. **Data Fetching**: Safe error handling in data fetcher functions
3. **Data Processing**: Defensive coding with fallbacks for missing data
4. **UI Components**: Graceful degradation with helpful error states
5. **Logging**: Structured error logging with context for debugging

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17 or later
- A GitHub account
- GitHub OAuth application credentials

### Setup GitHub OAuth

1. Go to your GitHub account settings
2. Navigate to "Developer settings" > "OAuth Apps" > "New OAuth App"
3. Register a new application with the following settings:
   - Application name: GitPulse (or your preferred name)
   - Homepage URL: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Authorization callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
4. After registration, note your Client ID and generate a Client Secret

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phrazzld/gitpulse.git
cd gitpulse
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root (use `.env.local.example` as a template):
```
# GitHub OAuth
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret

# NextAuth.js
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_key_here

# Gemini API
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
# Standard development server
npm run dev

# Development with debug logging to file
npm run dev:log
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Storybook

GitPulse uses Storybook for UI component development and documentation:

```bash
# Run Storybook development server
npm run storybook

# Build static Storybook site
npm run build-storybook
```

Storybook provides an isolated environment for developing and testing UI components without needing to run the full application. It helps with:

- Component development in isolation
- Visual testing of component states
- Documentation of component usage
- Showcasing the component library

After running `npm run storybook`, open the displayed URL in your browser (typically http://localhost:6006) to view the component library.

## Security

GitPulse implements multiple layers of security to protect sensitive credentials:

### Pre-commit Secret Detection
- **Automatic scanning** of staged files using secretlint
- **Prevents accidental commits** of API keys, tokens, and other secrets
- Configure patterns in `.secretlintrc.json`

### CI/CD Security Checks
- **GitHub Actions** workflow for continuous security scanning
- **Gitleaks** integration for detecting secrets in code
- **Dependency auditing** with npm audit

### Best Practices
- Never commit `.env.local` or files with real credentials
- Use `.env.local.example` as a template with placeholders
- Generate secure NextAuth secrets: `openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d "=+/" | cut -c1-32`
- Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
- See `.github/SECURITY.md` for detailed security guidelines

## Usage

1. Sign in with your GitHub account
2. Select whether you want an individual or team summary
3. For team summaries, enter comma-separated GitHub usernames
4. Select a date range for your summary
5. Optionally select specific repositories
6. Click "Generate Summary" to view your commit statistics

### Troubleshooting Authentication

If you encounter GitHub authentication errors:

1. Click the "Sign Out" button in the dashboard header
2. Sign back in with your GitHub account to refresh your access token
3. If problems persist, ensure your GitHub OAuth app still has the necessary permissions

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy GitPulse is using Vercel:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Import your repository on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Set the environment variables in the Vercel project settings
4. Deploy the application

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization

When adding new features or making changes, follow these guidelines:

1. **Types First**: Always define types in dedicated type modules first
2. **Hooks for Logic**: Extract business logic into custom hooks
3. **Component Separation**: Keep components focused and single-responsibility
4. **Defensive Programming**: Always handle error cases and edge conditions
5. **Tests Required**: Write tests for all new functionality

### Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Follow ESLint and TypeScript guidelines (run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck`)
- Keep files under 500 lines (warning threshold)
- Use immutable patterns where possible (readonly modifiers, const, etc.)
- Document the "why" not just the "how" in comments

### Error Handling Principles

When implementing error handling, follow this pattern:

1. Use try/catch blocks around API calls and data transformations
2. Log errors with context using the structured logger
3. Transform errors into user-friendly messages
4. Ensure UI components can handle and display error states gracefully
5. Provide recovery paths when possible
