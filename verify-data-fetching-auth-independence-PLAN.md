# Verify Data Fetching Auth Independence

## Task Title
Verify Data Fetching Auth Independence

## Implementation Approach
Systematically review all functions in githubData.ts that accept an Octokit instance to ensure they: (1) properly validate that the Octokit parameter is provided, (2) make no direct access to auth credentials or tokens, (3) rely exclusively on the provided Octokit instance for all GitHub API calls, and (4) handle errors appropriately without making assumptions about the authentication method.
