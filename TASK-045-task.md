# TASK-045: Replace other identified `any` usages with appropriate types

## Task ID
TASK-045

## Title
Replace other identified `any` usages with appropriate types

## Original Ticket Text
- [~] **TASK-045: Replace other identified `any` usages with appropriate types**
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Effort**: Large
  - **Dependencies**: TASK-041
  - **Success Criteria**: All `any` usages replaced with proper types
  - **Description**:
    - For each instance identified in TASK-041, replace with appropriate types
    - Use `unknown` with type guards, specific interfaces, or generic types
    - Run TypeScript compiler to ensure all replacements are valid

## Implementation Approach Analysis

This task requires replacing the remaining `any` type usages in the codebase with more appropriate TypeScript types, as identified in the TASK-041 report. The goal is to improve type safety across the codebase while ensuring all functionality continues to work as expected.

### Current Understanding

1. The TASK-041 report identified several categories of `any` usage:
   - Error handling patterns (`catch (error: any)`)
   - Function parameters using `any`
   - State and component props using `any`
   - Type assertions (`as any`)
   - Test-related usage
   - Interface/Type definitions using `any`

2. The report provided a priority order for remediation:
   1. Error handling patterns
   2. Function parameters
   3. State and component props
   4. Type assertions
   5. Test-related usage

3. Recommended approaches include:
   - Using `unknown` with type guards for better safety
   - Creating specific interfaces where appropriate
   - Using generic types for flexible but type-safe code

### Key Questions

1. What specific types should be used to replace each category of `any` usage?
2. How can we ensure backward compatibility while improving type safety?
3. What type guards or assertions will be needed to handle `unknown` types?
4. How can we ensure that all changes are type safe and don't break existing functionality?

### Proposed Approach

1. Break down the task by category according to the prioritization in the TASK-041 report
2. Develop a strategy for each category:
   - Error handling: Replace `error: any` with `error: unknown` and use type guards
   - Function parameters: Create appropriate interfaces or use generics
   - State/props: Define proper types for components and state variables
   - Type assertions: Replace `as any` with proper type assertions or type guards
   - Test usage: Improve type safety in test files where feasible

3. Implement changes incrementally, testing after each category is addressed
4. Run type checking and tests throughout to ensure no regressions

### Technical Considerations

1. Changing to `unknown` will require type guards to access properties
2. Some changes may require refactoring to support proper typing
3. Test-related code may require less stringent typing to maintain test flexibility
4. Components with index signatures (`[key: string]: any`) may need specific props interfaces
5. NextAuth.js session types may need special consideration
6. Some types from external libraries may need to be imported for better type safety
