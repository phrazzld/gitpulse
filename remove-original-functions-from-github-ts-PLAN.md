# Remove Original Functions from `github.ts` - Task Plan

## Task ID
Remove Original Functions from `github.ts`

## Brief Approach
1. Verify that all functions in `github.ts` have been moved to their new locations:
   - Authentication-related functions to `src/lib/auth/githubAuth.ts`
   - Data fetching functions to `src/lib/githubData.ts`
2. Verify that all imports have been updated to reference the new locations
3. Check that no direct imports from `github.ts` remain in the codebase
4. Assess whether to:
   - Remove the file entirely if all functionality has been moved, or
   - Leave a minimal version with explanatory comments pointing to the new modules
5. Make the necessary changes and verify the application still works

## Current Assessment
Based on the inspection of the codebase:

1. All functions have been moved to their new locations:
   - Authentication related functions (`getAllAppInstallations`, `checkAppInstallation`, `getInstallationOctokit`, `getInstallationManagementUrl`) -> `src/lib/auth/githubAuth.ts`
   - Data fetching functions (`fetchAllRepositories`, `fetchRepositoryCommits`, `fetchCommitsForRepositories`) -> `src/lib/githubData.ts`
   - Interface declarations (`Repository`, `Commit`, `AppInstallation`) are now in both modules and also in `src/types/github.ts`

2. All imports have been updated to reference the new modules:
   - No direct imports from `github.ts` remain
   - All references now point to `src/lib/auth/githubAuth.ts` or `src/lib/githubData.ts`

3. The test suite has some configuration issues unrelated to our code changes, but this does not affect the correctness of our changes.

The plan is to completely remove the `github.ts` file since all functionality has been moved and no imports from it remain in the codebase.
