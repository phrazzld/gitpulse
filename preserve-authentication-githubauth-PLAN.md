# T013: Preserve Authentication in githubAuth.ts

## Task ID and Title
**T013:** Preserve authentication in githubAuth.ts

## Assessment
This is a simple task that involves reviewing and maintaining the authentication functionality in `src/lib/auth/githubAuth.ts`. The file already appears to be well-structured and focused on both OAuth and GitHub App authentication mechanisms without specific dependencies on team/organization features that are being removed from the application.

## Current State
- The `githubAuth.ts` module contains functions for:
  - Creating authenticated Octokit instances (`createAuthenticatedOctokit`)
  - Getting installation management URLs (`getInstallationManagementUrl`)
  - Retrieving GitHub App installations (`getAllAppInstallations`)
  - Checking if the GitHub App is installed (`checkAppInstallation`)
- Functions properly support both OAuth and GitHub App authentication
- Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Unit tests exist to verify the main authentication functionality

## Implementation Approach
1. Review the code to ensure no dependencies on team/organization-specific features that are being removed
2. Verify that all required authentication functions are maintained:
   - `createAppAuth`
   - `getAllAppInstallations`
   - `checkAppInstallation`
   - `createAuthenticatedOctokit`
3. Verify that both authentication mechanisms (OAuth and GitHub App) are preserved
4. Run existing tests to ensure functionality is maintained
5. Document findings and confirm that the authentication functionality works for individual user focus

## Details
- No code changes should be required as the authentication functions already:
  - Work for both authentication methods (OAuth and GitHub App)
  - Don't have explicit dependencies on team/organization features
  - Support individual user authentication well

The task is focused on verification rather than modification.
