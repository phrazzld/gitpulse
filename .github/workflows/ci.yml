          ### About These Thresholds
          - These are **realistic thresholds** set to prevent regression, not aspirational targets
          - **Component-level coverage** is enforced by Jest during test execution
          - **Global coverage** shown above represents the overall project coverage
          - Jest will fail the build if any component-specific thresholds are not met

          > üìä **Component Coverage**: Enforced by Jest at build time
          > - **Atoms**: Lines ‚â•75%, Statements ‚â•75%, Functions ‚â•83%, Branches ‚â•50%  
          > - **Molecules**: Lines ‚â•43%, Statements ‚â•42%, Functions ‚â•41%, Branches ‚â•43%
          > - **Organisms**: Lines ‚â•25%, Statements ‚â•24%, Functions ‚â•25%, Branches ‚â•31%
          
          ${{ steps.read-coverage.outputs.coverage_status != 'success' && '### Troubleshooting\nIf coverage data is missing or failed to process:\n1.
