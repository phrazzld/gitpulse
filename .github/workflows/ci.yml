          ### About These Thresholds
          - These are **realistic thresholds** set to prevent regression, not aspirational targets
          - **Component-level coverage** is enforced by Jest during test execution
          - **Global coverage** shown above represents the overall project coverage
          - Jest will fail the build if any component-specific thresholds are not met

          > - **Organisms**: Lines ‚â•25%, Statements ‚â•24%, Functions ‚â•25%, Branches ‚â•31%
