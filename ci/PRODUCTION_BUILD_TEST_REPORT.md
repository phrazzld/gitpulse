# Production Build Test Report

This report documents the behavior of E2E authentication tests when run against a production build versus development server.

## Test Setup

**Environment**:
- Production build created with `NODE_ENV=production npm run build`
- Production server started with test authentication enabled
- Tests run with and without CI mode

## Test Results

### 1. Basic Authentication Cookie Test
**Test**: `should have valid auth cookie from global setup`
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED
- **Conclusion**: Basic cookie verification works in production

### 2. Authentication Persistence Test  
**Test**: `should maintain authenticated state across navigation`
- **Without CI mode**: ❌ FAILED - Initial auth cookie not found
- **With CI mode**: ❌ FAILED - Initial auth cookie not found (even with 500ms delays)
- **Error**: Cookie exists in global setup but is lost when test starts

## Key Findings

1. **Production vs Development Behavior**:
   - The authentication persistence test fails consistently against production build
   - The same test passes against development server (with CI timing fix)
   - Basic cookie tests pass in both environments

2. **Cookie Persistence Issue**:
   - Cookies set in global setup are verified to exist
   - However, when the authentication persistence test runs, the cookie is missing
   - This suggests a different cookie handling mechanism in production

3. **Timing Fix Ineffective**:
   - The 500ms delays added for CI mode don't help in production
   - The issue appears to be fundamental rather than timing-related

## Root Cause Analysis

The authentication persistence test failure in production is likely due to:

1. **Different Cookie Handling**: Production builds may handle httpOnly cookies differently
2. **Context Isolation**: Production mode might have stricter context isolation
3. **Session Management**: NextAuth.js might behave differently in production mode

## Recommendations

1. **Investigation Priority**: This is not a critical issue since:
   - Tests pass in development (where most testing occurs)
   - The CI workflow uses development server (aligns with test design)
   - Production testing would require different test strategies

2. **Long-term Solutions**:
   - Consider using API-based authentication setup instead of cookie injection
   - Investigate NextAuth.js production mode behavior
   - Design tests that work consistently across all environments

3. **Current Workaround**: 
   - Continue using development server for E2E tests in CI
   - The implemented timing fix addresses the CI-specific issue adequately

## Conclusion

The authentication persistence test is environment-sensitive and fails against production builds due to fundamental differences in cookie/session handling. Since CI runs tests against development server (matching the dedicated E2E workflow), this is not a blocking issue. The timing fix implemented earlier successfully addresses the original CI failure.
