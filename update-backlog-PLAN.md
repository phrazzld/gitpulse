# T014: Update BACKLOG.md - PLAN

## Task ID/Title
T014: Update BACKLOG.md

## Approach
1. Edit BACKLOG.md to remove references to the now-completed "GitHub Library Restructuring" section.
2. Review other tasks mentioned in the backlog and update their statuses if they have been addressed by recent refactoring work.
3. Ensure the updates maintain the document's structure and readability.
