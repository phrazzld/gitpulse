# Task Description

## Issue Details
Issue #95: RADICAL: Eliminate testing complexity by making code inherently testable
URL: https://github.com/phrazzld/gitpulse/issues/95

## Overview
GitPulse has elaborate testing infrastructure with complex mocking, test doubles, setup functions, and brittle integration tests. This creates hundreds of lines of test code that often breaks and provides little confidence. The solution is to make the code so simple and functional that it becomes inherently testable without elaborate setup.

## Requirements
### Eliminate Testing Infrastructure (~580 lines)
- Complex mock setup functions (~200 lines)
- Internal component mocking (~150 lines)
- Elaborate test utilities and helpers (~100 lines)
- Custom rendering functions (~80 lines)
- Test-specific configuration (~50 lines)

### Eliminate Test Complexity
- Tests that mock multiple internal services
- Tests that require complex state setup
- Tests that break when implementation changes
- Tests that verify mock interactions instead of behavior

### Create Inherently Testable Architecture
- Replace complex classes and stateful components with pure functions
- Build complex behavior from simple, testable functions using functional composition
- Separate side effects (API calls, logging) from business logic
- Make components pure functions of props

## Technical Context
### Current Testing Pain Points
- Tests are brittle and break with minor implementation changes
- Complex mocking setup makes tests hard to write and maintain
- Tests often verify implementation details rather than behavior
- Test execution is slow due to complex setup/teardown
- Low confidence in test coverage despite high line counts

### Target Architecture
- Pure functions for all business logic
- Side effects isolated to boundaries
- Functional composition patterns
- No internal mocking required
- Simple unit tests that test behavior

### Leyline Framework Alignment
- **Testability Tenet**: Code must be structured for comprehensive, reliable testing
- **No Internal Mocking Binding**: Never mock components within application boundaries
- **Pure Functions Binding**: Maximize pure functions, isolate side effects
- **Functional Composition**: Build complex behavior from simple functions

## Related Issues
- **#92**: URL-driven state (will help eliminate stateful components)
- **#88**: Dependency injection (will help with testability)
- **#84**: Eliminate internal component mocking (directly related)
- **#93**: Delete optimization code (simplifies testing)

## Success Criteria
- 80%+ reduction in test setup code
- Zero internal mocking in tests
- All business logic in pure functions
- Tests focus on behavior, not implementation
- Faster test execution times
- Higher confidence in test suite
