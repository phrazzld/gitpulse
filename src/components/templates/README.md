# Templates

Templates are page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design's underlying content structure.

In this directory, we store components that:

- Define overall page structure and layout
- Arrange organisms, molecules, and atoms into a complete interface
- Focus on the structure rather than the content (placeholders vs. real content)
- Establish consistent patterns for page layouts

## Examples

- Dashboard layout
- Settings page template
- Authentication page template
- Report view template
- Profile page template

## Guidelines

- Templates should focus on layout and structure, not specific content
- They should be flexible enough to accommodate different content requirements
- Templates should maximize reuse of organisms, molecules, and atoms
- Components should be thoroughly documented with TSDoc comments
- All components must have appropriate test coverage
- Each template should have corresponding Storybook stories demonstrating various content configurations
