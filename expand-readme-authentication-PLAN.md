# T011: Expand README "Authentication" section - PLAN

## Task ID/Title
T011: Expand README "Authentication" section

## Approach
1. Review the current README.md authentication section and identify areas for improvement
2. Analyze the authentication code in the codebase, particularly `src/lib/auth/githubAuth.ts`
3. Enhance the README authentication section to include:
   - Comprehensive explanation of both OAuth and GitHub App authentication methods
   - Clearer configuration instructions for both methods
   - Use cases for each authentication method (when to use which)
   - How the authentication flow works at a high level
4. Maintain the README's existing style and structure
5. Ensure the updated documentation is both thorough and accessible to new users
