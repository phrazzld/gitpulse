# T011: Refactor SummaryDisplay Component

## Task ID and Title
**T011**: Refactor SummaryDisplay component

## Assessment
This is a simple task focused on removing organization and team-specific conditional rendering logic from the SummaryDisplay component. The SummaryDisplay component is responsible for displaying commit activity, metrics, and AI analysis.

## Current Issues
1. The ActivityFeed is conditionally configured based on activity mode
2. The empty message changes based on activity mode
3. There are tests that verify different behavior for team-activity mode
4. Organization filters are still being passed to the API endpoint

## Implementation Approach
1. Simplify the ActivityFeed configuration to always:
   - Use the '/api/my-activity' endpoint unconditionally
   - Remove showContributor prop as it's no longer needed
   - Use a simpler, consistent empty message

2. Update the emptyMessage to be mode-independent:
   - Remove activity mode references
   - Use a generic "No activity found for the selected filters"

3. Update the tests:
   - Remove the team-activity mode test
   - Simplify tests that check for mode-dependent behavior
   - Ensure existing functionality still works

## Details
1. In the component:
   - Simplify the loadCommits function to only use /api/my-activity
   - Remove conditional empty message formatting
   - Keep organization filters for backward compatibility

2. In the tests:
   - Remove test for team-activity mode
   - Update remaining tests to work with the simplified component
