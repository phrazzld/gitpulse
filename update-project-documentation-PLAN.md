# Update Project Documentation - Task Plan

## Task ID
Update Project Documentation

## Brief Approach
1. Review the existing documentation in README.md, CLAUDE.md, and .env.local.example
2. Identify sections that need to be updated based on the recent GitHub authentication and data fetching module refactoring
3. Update documentation to reflect the new architecture and authentication flow
4. Ensure the documentation is clear and consistent with the actual implementation
5. Run linting checks to ensure documentation meets standards

## Current Assessment
After reviewing the relevant files, I've identified the following items that need to be updated:

1. **README.md:**
   - The Tech Stack section mentions GitHub API interaction but doesn't describe the architecture separating authentication and data fetching
   - The Environment Variables section doesn't include GitHub App configuration options that might be needed after the refactoring
   - Authentication troubleshooting section could be enhanced to explain GitHub App installation options

2. **CLAUDE.md:**
   - Authentication Flow section only mentions OAuth, but now the system supports both OAuth and GitHub App authentication
   - Project Structure doesn't mention the lib/auth subdirectory that now exists

3. **.env.local.example:**
   - Missing GitHub App environment variables that would be needed for GitHub App authentication

The plan is to update these files to accurately reflect the current architecture, particularly the separation of authentication and data fetching, and support for both OAuth and GitHub App authentication methods.
