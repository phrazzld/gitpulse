# Test Pre-commit Hook with Lint Error

## Test Procedure

1. **ESLint Configuration Migration**

   - Migrated from .eslintrc.js to eslint.config.mjs using the new flat config format
   - Created a comprehensive configuration that includes:
     - TypeScript rules (no-explicit-any, etc.)
     - React and Next.js rules
     - Code quality rules (max-lines, complexity, etc.)
     - ES Lint comments rules

2. **Lint-staged Configuration Update**

   - Updated lint-staged configuration to use the new ESLint setup
   - Removed the `--fix` flag to ensure errors are not automatically fixed
   - Restored ESLint checking to the pre-commit process

3. **Test File Creation**

   - Created a test file `src/hooks/useDebounceTest.ts` with deliberate linting errors:
     - Using `var` instead of `let` or `const` (error level)
     - Unused variables with non-camel case names (warning level)
     - Usage of `any` type (warning level)
     - Unused eslint-disable directive (warning level)

4. **Commit Attempt**
   - Staged the file with linting errors
   - Attempted to commit with the message "test: adding file with more lint errors to test pre-commit hook"

## Results

- **Pre-commit Hook Behavior**:

  - The pre-commit hook successfully ran ESLint on the staged file
  - ESLint detected 1 error and 5 warnings in the file
  - The commit was blocked due to the linting error
  - A detailed error message was displayed showing all the linting issues

- **Verification**:
  - Confirmed that the commit was prevented when linting errors were present
  - The pre-commit hook is functioning correctly for linting errors

## Conclusion

The pre-commit hook is successfully configured to run ESLint and prevent commits that have linting errors. This ensures code quality standards are maintained throughout the development process.

The ESLint configuration has been fully migrated to the new flat config format, and the integration with lint-staged is working correctly. The pre-commit hook now enforces code quality by catching errors before they are committed to the repository.
