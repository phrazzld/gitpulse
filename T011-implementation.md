# T011 Implementation Verification

## Changes Made

- Installed lint-staged as a dev dependency (husky was already installed)
- Added lint-staged configuration to package.json to format \*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,css,md} files with prettier
- Updated the pre-commit hook to run lint-staged before other checks
- Fixed a syntax error in the pre-commit hook script

## Validation

- Tested the setup with a deliberately unformatted file
- Confirmed that lint-staged automatically formats staged files when attempting to commit
- Confirmed the pre-commit hook runs without errors
- Verified that the hook continues to perform existing checks like linting, type checking, and file length verification

## Completion Criteria

- [x] lint-staged is installed and configured in package.json
- [x] husky pre-commit hook has been updated to run lint-staged
- [x] Automated formatting of staged files works when committing

All completion criteria have been met.
