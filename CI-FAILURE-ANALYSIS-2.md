# CI Failure Analysis for Installation ID Resolution Tests

## Issue Summary

The CI build is failing in the "Run tests" step with 5 failed tests, all related to the installation ID resolution functionality in the `installation-id-options.test.ts` file. These tests are failing after our previous fix to the GitHub error type handling tests.

## Failure Details

### 1. Filter Non-Numeric Values Test Failure

```
● Installation ID Resolution Options › resolveMultipleInstallationIds with custom options › should filter out non-numeric values from query parameter

  expect(received).toEqual(expected) // deep equality

  - Expected  - 4
  + Received  + 1

  - Array [
  -   12345,
  -   67890,
  - ]
  + Array []
```

The test at line 215 expects `resolveMultipleInstallationIds` to return `[12345, 67890]` but it's returning an empty array.

### 2. Installation Availability Validation Test Failure

```
● Installation ID Resolution Options › resolveMultipleInstallationIds with custom options › should respect installation availability validation when enabled

  expect(received).toEqual(expected) // deep equality

  - Expected  - 1
  + Received  + 0

    Array [
      12345,
  -   67890,
    ]
```

The test at line 231 expects `resolveMultipleInstallationIds` to return `[12345, 67890]` but it's returning only `[12345]`.

### 3. Validation Disabled Test Failure

```
● Installation ID Resolution Options › resolveMultipleInstallationIds with custom options › should not validate against available installations when disabled

  expect(received).toEqual(expected) // deep equality

  - Expected  - 2
  + Received  + 0

    Array [
      12345,
  -   99999,
  -   67890,
    ]
```

The test at line 248 expects `resolveMultipleInstallationIds` to return `[12345, 99999, 67890]` but it's returning only `[12345]`.

### 4. requireInstallationId Valid Test Failure

```
● Installation ID Resolution Options › requireInstallationId behavior › should return installation ID when valid

  No installation ID found
```

The test at line 322 is calling `requireInstallationId` which is throwing an error with message "No installation ID found" instead of returning the expected installation ID.

### 5. requireInstallationId Error Source Test Failure

```
● Installation ID Resolution Options › requireInstallationId behavior › should throw error with proper metadata when invalid

  expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

  Expected: "query"
  Received: "none"
```

In the test at line 350, the error thrown by `requireInstallationId` has a source property of `"none"` but the test expects it to be `"query"`.

## Root Causes

After analyzing the code, I've identified the following root causes:

1. **Query Parameter Parsing Issue**: The `resolveMultipleInstallationIds` function in installationHelper.ts doesn't seem to be correctly parsing the query parameters or is filtering out valid IDs.

2. **Installation ID Source Tracking**: The source tracking for invalid installation IDs appears to be incorrect - it's returning "none" instead of "query" when an invalid ID is provided in the query parameters.

3. **Validation Logic**: The validation logic for installation IDs may have changed, causing the tests that expect certain validation behavior to fail.

## Changes Required

To fix these issues, we need to:

1. Debug the `resolveMultipleInstallationIds` function to understand why it's not correctly parsing or returning the expected installation IDs.

2. Check the source tracking logic in the `resolveInstallationId` function to ensure it correctly reports the source even when validation fails.

3. Update the test expectations if the validation behavior has intentionally changed, or fix the implementation if it's a regression.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add debugging to understand why `resolveMultipleInstallationIds` is returning empty or incomplete arrays.
2. Fix the implementation to correctly parse and validate installation IDs from query parameters.
3. Ensure the source is correctly tracked throughout the validation process.
4. Run tests locally to verify fixes before committing.

## Recommended Test Fixes

If the changes to the implementation are intentional, we should update the tests to match:

1. For test at line 215, update the expectation for `resolveMultipleInstallationIds` to match the actual implementation behavior.
2. For tests at lines 231 and 248, update the expectations based on the current validation logic.
3. For the requireInstallationId tests, adjust the source expectations to match the current implementation.

These tests appear to be checking critical functionality for resolving installation IDs from different sources, which is a core part of the authentication and permissions model, so we should be careful to ensure the implementation is correct and the tests accurately reflect the expected behavior.
