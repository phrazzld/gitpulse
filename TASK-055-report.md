# TASK-055: Update tests to use native RTL methods directly

## Overview
This task involved migrating our test files from using custom React Testing Library (RTL) wrappers to using the native RTL methods directly. This makes our tests more maintainable, easier to understand, and aligned with RTL best practices.

## What Was Done

### 1. Updated Hook Test Files
We updated the following test files to use native RTL methods:
- `src/hooks/dashboard/__tests__/useCommits.test.ts`
- `src/hooks/dashboard/__tests__/useRepositories.test.ts`
- `src/hooks/dashboard/__tests__/useSummary.test.ts`

### 2. Removed Custom Utilities
We replaced the following custom utilities with their native RTL equivalents:
- `renderHookSafely` → `renderHook` from @testing-library/react
- Custom wrapper implementation → Simple React.createElement pattern
- Type castings and suppressions → Proper TypeScript typing

### 3. Created Better Patterns
We established better testing patterns:
- Created reusable wrapper factory functions (`createWrapper`)
- Improved test clarity and readability
- Used proper act() wrapping for async operations
- Maintained consistent patterns across test files

## Key Changes Made

1. **Replaced Custom Wrapper with Native RTL**
   ```typescript
   // Before
   const { result } = renderHookSafely(() => useCommits(defaultProps), {
     wrapper
   });
   
   // After
   const { result } = renderHook(() => useCommits(defaultProps), {
     wrapper: createWrapper()
   });
   ```

2. **Improved Wrapper Implementation**
   ```typescript
   // Before
   function wrapper({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
     return React.createElement(
       FetchProvider,
       { fetchImplementation: mockFetch } as any,
       children
     );
   }
   
   // After
   const createWrapper = () => {
     return ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => 
       React.createElement(
         FetchProvider,
         { fetchImplementation: mockFetch },
         children
       );
   };
   ```

3. **Cleaner Type Handling**
   ```typescript
   // Before
   (getStaleItem as any).mockReturnValue({ data: null, isStale: true });
   
   // After
   (getStaleItem as jest.Mock).mockReturnValue({ data: null, isStale: true });
   ```

## Testing Results
All tests continued to pass after the changes, confirming that our migration to native RTL methods was successful. The tests maintain the same functionality and assertions while using the more standard RTL approach.

## Benefits
1. **Increased maintainability**: By using standard RTL methods, our tests are now easier to understand, maintain, and update.
2. **Better alignment with community standards**: Our tests now follow common React testing patterns.
3. **Improved type safety**: We've removed various type suppressions and `any` casts.
4. **Better readability**: The tests are more explicit and clear about what they're testing.
5. **Easier onboarding**: New developers will find it easier to understand our tests since they use standard patterns.

## Next Steps
1. Continue updating any remaining tests to use native RTL methods
2. Consider simplifying further by using the RTL Testing Library's built-in utilities for common patterns
3. Consider adding additional test utilities to our codebase for patterns that aren't covered by RTL directly but are common in our application
