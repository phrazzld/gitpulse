# TASK-061: Update Jest Coverage Configuration - Implementation Report

## Overview

This task focused on ensuring that Jest coverage thresholds are properly enforced in CI and making improvements to the coverage reporting in PR comments. The primary goal was to guarantee that CI builds fail if coverage thresholds aren't met.

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Jest Configuration Documentation

- Added clear comments to `jest.config.js` explaining:
  - That coverage thresholds are enforced when running with the `--coverage` flag
  - That CI will fail if thresholds are not met
  - That thresholds are aligned with the requirements in DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_TESTING.md

### 2. Enhanced CI Workflow Clarity

- Updated comments in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to explicitly state:
  - That the test step will fail if coverage thresholds are not met
  - What the specific thresholds are for different component types
  - That Jest is configured to enforce these thresholds

### 3. Improved PR Coverage Reporting

- Enhanced the PR comment template to:
  - Add visual indicators (✅/❌) to coverage metrics to show which ones meet or fall below thresholds
  - Include a more detailed explanation of the thresholds for each component type
  - Add a legend explaining the indicators
  - Add a note that CI will fail if any threshold is not met

## Verification

The changes ensure that:
1. Coverage thresholds are clearly documented in the Jest configuration
2. The CI workflow explicitly notes that builds will fail if coverage thresholds aren't met
3. PR comments provide clear visual feedback on coverage metrics

## Coverage Thresholds

The following thresholds are now clearly documented and enforced:

- **Global**: ≥ 80% (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- **Atoms**: ≥ 90% (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- **Molecules**: ≥ 85% (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- **Organisms**: ≥ 80% (branches, functions, lines, statements)

## Conclusion

These changes improve clarity and documentation around code coverage requirements without changing the actual thresholds, which were already properly configured. The PR comment enhancements make it immediately obvious when coverage falls below thresholds, helping developers address coverage issues before merging PRs.
