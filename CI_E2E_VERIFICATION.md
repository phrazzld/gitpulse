# CI E2E Test Verification

This document describes the verification process for ensuring E2E tests pass reliably in the CI environment with mock authentication.

## Key Improvements

Several improvements were made to ensure reliable E2E test execution in CI:

### Enhanced Global Setup

- Added detailed logging of environment variables and cookie state
- Improved cookie verification with detailed attribute checking
- Added a debug storage state file in CI for troubleshooting

### Improved Server Health Check

- Updated wait-for-server.js script to be more resilient in CI
- Added consecutive success requirements to ensure server is fully ready
- Increased timeouts and request timeout handling
- Added server log capture for better debugging

### CI Workflow Enhancements

- Added build step with appropriate environment variables
- Enhanced server startup with log capture 
- Improved test execution with timing information and retries
- Added detailed environment report generation
- Included comprehensive artifact collection for debugging

### Playwright Configuration Improvements

- Adjusted timeouts for CI environment
- Enhanced tracing and debugging in CI
- Configured browser-specific settings for all supported browsers
- Disabled built-in webServer in CI since we manage it manually

## Verification Process

The verification was performed by:

1. Creating a dedicated test branch (`verify-e2e-ci-auth`)
2. Implementing the enhancements described above
3. Creating a pull request to trigger the CI workflow
4. Analyzing CI logs for any issues or failures
5. Making iterative improvements until all tests passed reliably

## Results

The E2E tests now pass reliably in CI across all configured browsers:

- **Chromium**: All tests pass consistently
- **Firefox**: All tests pass consistently
- **WebKit**: All tests pass consistently

The mock authentication system correctly creates and maintains the authentication state for tests, eliminating the need for UI login steps while ensuring authenticated page access.

## Recommendations

For maintaining reliable E2E test execution in CI:

1. Always capture server logs for debugging
2. Ensure adequate timeouts for CI environment, which may be slower than local
3. Use the artifact collection to diagnose failures
4. Take advantage of the detailed reporting for environment-specific issues
