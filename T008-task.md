# T008: Configure storybook-a11y as a blocking CI check

## Task ID: T008

## Title: Configure `storybook-a11y` as a blocking CI check

## Original Ticket Text:
- **T008: Configure `storybook-a11y` as a blocking CI check**
  - Verify or update CI configuration to ensure accessibility failures block PRs
  - Test with a deliberate failure to confirm blocking behavior

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt:

Analyze the following task and provide a comprehensive implementation approach that aligns with our Development Philosophy and best practices.

**Key Requirements:**
1. Make Storybook accessibility tests block PRs when violations are found
2. Ensure critical and serious accessibility violations fail the CI build
3. Test the configuration with a deliberate failure to confirm it works
4. Maintain the ability to skip specific tests if needed for exceptional cases

**Current State:**
- The `.github/workflows/storybook-a11y.yml` workflow exists
- The workflow sets `SKIP_A11Y_FAILURES: true` which prevents blocking
- The test-runner-setup.js is configured to fail on violations in CI when `SKIP_A11Y_FAILURES` is not true
- The infrastructure is in place but configured to only warn, not fail

**Constraints:**
- Must align with the Development Philosophy's CI/CD principles
- Should fail fast on accessibility violations
- Must provide clear feedback about what failed
- Should not break existing test infrastructure
