# T012: Pre-commit Hook Type Error Test Report

## Test Procedure

1. Modified `src/hooks/useDebounce.ts` to introduce a type error by assigning a string value to a variable of type number
2. Verified that `npm run typecheck` caught the error
3. Staged the file with `git add src/hooks/useDebounce.ts`
4. Attempted to commit with `git commit -m "Testing pre-commit hook - this should fail due to type error"`

## Results

- The pre-commit hook successfully ran and detected the TypeScript type error
- The commit was prevented with the following error message:

```
âœ– tsc --noEmit:
src/hooks/useDebounce.ts(6,9): error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
husky - pre-commit script failed (code 1)
```

- This confirms that the TypeScript type checking in the pre-commit hook is working correctly
- Files were restored to their original state after the test

## Observations

- There was an issue with ESLint v9 not finding the configuration file (it expects eslint.config.js instead of .eslintrc.js)
- For the test, we temporarily modified the lint-staged configuration to remove ESLint and focus on TypeScript type checking
- The pre-commit hook successfully prevented the commit due to the type error, which confirms that the TypeScript strict mode checks are functioning correctly in the pre-commit process
