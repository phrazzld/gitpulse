- **Status**: 2 Failed Checks, 1 Passing Check

## Failed Checks

### 1. build-and-test

#### Error Details
The build-and-test workflow failed due to test failures in the Jest test suite:

1. **Unit Test Failures**:
   - `src/lib/github/__tests__/repositories.test.ts`: Failing test related to GitHub token validation
   ```
   expect(fetchAllRepositoriesOAuth('token')).rejects.toThrow(
     "GitHub token is missing 'repo' scope"
   );
   ```

2. **Type Error**:
   - `src/lib/__tests__/dashboard-utils.test.ts`: Cannot set property getTodayDate
   ```
   TypeError: Cannot set property getTodayDate of [object Object] which has only a getter
   ```
   
   Issue is at:
   ```javascript
   dashboardUtils.getTodayDate = originalGetTodayDate;
   dashboardUtils.getLastWeekDate = originalGetLastWeekDate;
   ```

#### Summary
- 7 test suites failed
- 16 tests failed
- 1 test skipped
- 300 tests passed

### 2. storybook-a11y

#### Error Details
The storybook-a11y workflow failed due to accessibility violations in the component stories:

1. **Accessibility Violations**: 
   - Detected in LoadMoreButton components
   - All 3 variants of LoadMoreButton fail:
     - Default
     - NoMoreItems
     - CustomLabels

2. **Error Pattern**:
   ```
   Expected value to strictly be equal to: 0
   Received: 1
   
   Message: 1 accessibility violation was detected
   ```

3. **Component Issue**:
   - The accessibility violation appears to be related to a button component with color contrast issues
   - Problematic element: `<button type="button" aria-busy="false" class="px-5 py-2 rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-all duration-200..."`
   - Colors involved: `background-color: var(--dark-slate, #1b2b34); color: var(--electric-blue, #0066cc)`

#### Summary
- 5 test suites failed
- 30 tests failed
- 16 tests passed

## Passing Checks

### 1. Playwright E2E Tests
- All end-to-end tests pass successfully

## Timeline
- Checks run on: 2025-05-15

## Related Files
- Recent commits indicate work on accessibility improvements:
  - `fix(accessibility): improve color contrast in LoadMoreButton component`
  - `fix(accessibility): improve color contrast in ModeSelector component`
  - `fix(accessibility): improve color contrast in OperationsPanel components`
  - `feat(accessibility): implement centralized color contrast utility`

## Causes and Solutions
1. **Unit test failures** may be due to:
   - Recent changes to the GitHub authentication workflow
   - Mocks that need updating
   - Incorrect getter/setter handling in test code
   
2. **Accessibility failures** are due to:
   - Color contrast issues in button components
   - Possible incomplete implementation of the color contrast utility
   - The atomic design migration may have broken existing accessibility fixes
