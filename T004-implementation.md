# T004 Implementation: CI Pipeline Type Checking

## Solution Overview

I created a new GitHub Actions CI workflow since there was no existing CI pipeline in the repository. The workflow:

1. Runs on both push to main branches and pull requests
2. Uses Node.js 18.x (which aligns with modern requirements)
3. Follows the standard CI flow for Node.js projects:
   - Checkout code
   - Setup Node.js with npm caching
   - Install dependencies
   - Run linting
   - Run type checking (the specific step for this task)
   - Run tests

## Key Implementation Details

The type checking step:
- Is positioned after dependency installation (required for it to work)
- Is positioned before the test step (to fail fast if there are type errors)
- Executes `npm run typecheck` which uses the root tsconfig.json we configured in T002
- Will fail the entire pipeline if type errors are found

## CI Workflow File

The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The specific type checking step is:

```yaml
- name: Type check
  run: npm run typecheck
  # This step specifically ensures that all source and test files are type-checked
  # It will fail if there are any type errors in the code, enforcing type safety
```

## Validation

This CI configuration:
- Ensures type checking of all files (including test files) as configured in T002 and T003
- Fails the build if any type errors are found
- Runs in the correct sequence (after deps, before tests)

The added workflow is not just a minimal implementation for the task, but a complete CI solution for the project that can be extended for other needs (like coverage checking and auditing in future tasks).
