# Refactor DashboardPage to Use New Components - Plan

## Task Description
Update parent component (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`) to use extracted components, replacing the original JSX blocks with instances of these components and passing all required state variables and functions as props.

## Implementation Approach
The dashboard page has already been refactored to use all extracted components. The implementation consists of:
1. Verifying that all components are properly imported and used within the dashboard
2. Confirming all required props are passed to each component
3. Running linting and type checking to ensure the refactoring is complete and correct
