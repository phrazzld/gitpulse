# TASK-056 Report: Peer Dependency Conflict Analysis

## Summary
After thorough investigation, I found that the project currently **does not have any active peer dependency conflicts** when running `npm install` without the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag. However, the flag is still being used in all CI workflow files, and it's mentioned in the dependency management documentation as being necessary.

## Current State Analysis

### Package.json Dependencies
The current dependencies, particularly React and Testing Library, are all compatible:
- React: ^19.0.0
- React DOM: ^19.0.0
- @types/react: ^19
- @types/react-dom: ^19
- @testing-library/react: ^16.3.0

### Dependency Resolution
Running `npm install` without the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag completes successfully with:
- No peer dependency conflicts reported
- All dependencies resolved correctly
- Type definitions properly aligned with their packages

### CI Configuration
Despite the lack of current conflicts, the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is still present in:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/chromatic.yml`
- `.github/workflows/storybook-a11y.yml`
- `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`

### Documentation
The `DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md` file states:
> "GitPulse uses the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag with npm to handle peer dependency conflicts, particularly with React 19 and related packages. This approach is necessary due to the incompatibility of some older packages with newer React versions."

## Historical Context

It appears that peer dependency conflicts were previously a problem, particularly when:
1. Moving to React 19
2. Using older testing libraries not fully compatible with the new React version

These conflicts have been resolved through dependency updates, most notably:
- Upgrading to @testing-library/react v16.3.0 (which supports React 19)
- Ensuring all type definitions (@types/*) are aligned with their respective libraries

## Recommendations for TASK-057

Based on these findings, we can safely:

1. Remove the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag from all CI workflow files
2. Update the documentation to reflect that the project no longer requires this flag
3. Perform additional testing by building the project in CI without the flag

## Conclusion

This task's stated goal was to identify specific peer dependency conflicts, but the analysis shows that all conflicts have already been resolved through proper dependency version management. The remaining work is to update the CI configuration and documentation to match the current state of the project.
