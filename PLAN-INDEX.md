# GitPulse Storybook Implementation Plan Index

Based on the scope analysis, the original Storybook implementation plan has been split into four focused, manageable parts:

## [PLAN-1: Storybook Core Setup & Configuration](./PLAN-1.md)
- Initial setup and configuration of Storybook
- Integrating with Next.js/TypeScript/TailwindCSS stack
- Setting up basic configuration files and structure

## [PLAN-2: Baseline Component Integration & Story Definition](./PLAN-2.md)
- Establishing a component library structure
- Selecting and integrating 3-5 initial components
- Creating well-documented stories using CSF3
- Defining conventions for future story creation

## [PLAN-3: Storybook CI Validation & Quality Gates](./PLAN-3.md)
- Integrating Storybook build into CI pipeline
- Ensuring lint and type checking for Storybook files
- Setting up quality gates and standards

Each plan is independently implementable and testable, with clear dependencies noted. This approach allows for incremental progress while maintaining manageable code reviews and focused work.
