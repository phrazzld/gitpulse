# T002CI Task Analysis

**Task ID**: T002CI

**Title**: Refactor summary API handlers for dependency injection

**Original Ticket Text**:
- [ ] **T002CI: Refactor summary API handlers for dependency injection**
  - Modify `src/app/api/summary/handlers.ts` to accept external dependencies explicitly
  - Dependencies should be injected via parameters or constructor arguments
  - **Depends on:** T001CI

**Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt**:

## Context
You are analyzing a code refactoring task for dependency injection in a Next.js API handler. The goal is to refactor the summary API handlers to accept external dependencies explicitly, following the principles of Dependency Injection.

## Current Architecture
- The handler is located at `src/app/api/summary/handlers.ts`
- This is a Next.js API route handler
- The handler likely uses GitHub services that were refactored in T001CI
- The handler may instantiate dependencies internally currently

## Requirements
1. Modify handlers to accept external dependencies via parameters or constructor arguments
2. Ensure compatibility with Next.js API route patterns
3. Maintain backward compatibility or provide migration path
4. Follow the dependency injection pattern established in T001CI

## Design Considerations
1. How to inject dependencies in a Next.js API route handler
2. Whether to use factory functions or class-based approach
3. How to handle the composition root for handlers
4. Ensuring testability improvements

## Expected Outcome
- Clear separation of concerns between handler logic and dependency instantiation
- Improved testability through dependency injection
- Consistent pattern with the GitHub modules refactoring from T001CI
- Tests that mock only external dependencies

## Additional Notes
- Remember that Next.js API routes have specific constraints
- The handler must work with Next.js's request/response model
- This task depends on T001CI which refactored GitHub modules for DI
