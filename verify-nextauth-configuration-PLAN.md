# T014: Verify NextAuth Configuration

## Task ID and Title
**T014:** Verify NextAuth configuration

## Assessment
This is a simple task that involves reviewing and verifying the NextAuth configuration in `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` to ensure it supports both OAuth and GitHub App authentication mechanisms.

## Current State
- The NextAuth configuration is defined in `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- It includes:
  - `ExtendedToken` and `ExtendedSession` types with `installationId` properties
  - GitHub OAuth provider with appropriate scopes
  - JWT and session callbacks for handling `installationId`
  - Custom handler for GitHub App installation callbacks

## Verification Tasks
1. Verify that both OAuth and GitHub App configurations are maintained:
   - Confirm GitHubProvider setup with correct scopes
   - Verify the GitHub App installation detection and handling

2. Verify `installationId` handling in JWT and session callbacks:
   - Ensure the JWT callback adds `installationId` to the token
   - Confirm the session callback adds `installationId` to the session

3. Verify `ExtendedToken` and `ExtendedSession` types are maintained:
   - Confirm these types include `installationId` property
   - Ensure token and session are properly typed

4. Test configuration functionality:
   - Run type checking to ensure there are no type errors
   - Review test files to ensure NextAuth mocking is consistent

## Implementation Approach
This task is primarily focused on verification rather than modification. The key steps are:
1. Review the existing code for compliance with the specifications above
2. Run type checking to confirm type safety
3. Ensure that no organization/team-specific code is present
4. Verify that all required fields are present in types and functions
5. Document the verification process and results

Since the functionality appears to be correctly implemented, no code changes should be required unless issues are found during verification.
