# T010CI TypeScript Errors Documentation

## Intentional TypeScript Errors

The following TypeScript errors are intentional and demonstrate that our type safety is working correctly for icon-only buttons:

1. `src/components/atoms/__tests__/Button.accessibility.test.tsx(257,10)` - Demonstrates that icon-only buttons missing aria-label fail TypeScript checks
2. `src/components/atoms/__tests__/Button.icon-accessibility.test.tsx(59,10)` - Test case showing icon-only button without aria-label
3. `src/components/atoms/__tests__/Button.icon-accessibility.test.tsx(78,10)` - Test case showing icon-only button without aria-label

These errors are expected and serve as regression tests to ensure the TypeScript discriminated union is working properly.

## Unrelated TypeScript Errors

The accessibility utility test errors are from a different task (T009CI) that has already been marked complete. These should be addressed separately and are not part of the T010CI task scope.
