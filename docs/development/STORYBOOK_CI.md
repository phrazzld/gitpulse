## 1. CI vs Local Environment Differences

Understanding the differences between local and CI environments is crucial for effective troubleshooting and test development.

### 1.1 Environment Constraints

**Resource Limitations**
- **Memory**: CI runners have limited memory allocation (typically 7GB on GitHub Actions)
- **CPU**: Shared CPU resources may cause timing-sensitive operations to behave differently
- **Disk I/O**: Network-attached storage may introduce latency not present locally
- **Network**: External dependencies may have different performance characteristics

**Process Management**
- **Port Allocation**: CI environments handle port management differently than local development
- **Process Cleanup**: Zombie processes can accumulate in CI without manual intervention
- **Signal Handling**: Process termination behavior differs between local shells and CI runners

### 1.2 Configuration Differences

**Environment Variables**
```bash
# CI-specific variables automatically set
CI=true
GITHUB_ACTIONS=true
RUNNER_OS=Linux

# Project-specific CI configuration
A11Y_ENHANCED_REPORTING=true
DEBUG=true
NODE_PATH=./node_modules
```

**Timeouts and Retries**
- **Local**: Conservative timeouts for developer experience
- **CI**: Extended timeouts (10+ minutes) to account for resource constraints
- **Retry Logic**: CI implements automatic retries for network operations

**Browser Configuration**
```javascript
// CI browser configuration (headless)
args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox', '--disable-dev-shm-usage']

// Local browser configuration (optional headful mode)
args: [] // Minimal restrictions for development
```

### 1.3 Why These Differences Matter

**Server Startup Timing**
- Local development benefits from warm caches and dedicated resources
- CI requires cold starts and competes for shared resources
- **Solution**: Enhanced retry logic and health checks in `scripts/storybook/start-server-with-retry.js`

**Test Execution**
- Local tests run against stable, dedicated browser instances
- CI tests must handle browser lifecycle management and resource contention
- **Solution**: Robust cleanup procedures and timeout protection

**Error Reporting**
- Local errors can be debugged interactively with full system access
- CI errors require comprehensive logging and artifact collection
- **Solution**: Enhanced logging in `scripts/storybook/run-a11y-tests-ci.js`

## 2. Common CI Issues and Solutions

### 2.1 Server Startup Failures

**Symptoms**
- Tests exit with code 1 during "Start Storybook server and run tests"
- Logs show port binding errors or timeout messages
- Missing `storybook-static/index.html` or `storybook-static/index.json`

**Root Causes**
- Port conflicts from previous test runs
- Storybook build artifacts corrupted or missing
- Resource exhaustion during server startup
- Race conditions in server initialization

**Solutions**
```bash
# Automated in CI workflow
npm run build-storybook    # Ensure fresh build
node scripts/storybook/run-a11y-tests-ci.js  # Enhanced startup with retries
```

**Prevention**
- Always verify build artifacts before starting server
- Implement health checks with appropriate timeouts
- Use unique ports or proper cleanup between runs

### 2.2 Accessibility Test Failures

**Symptoms**
- Tests report accessibility violations that don't occur locally
- Timeout errors during test execution
- Inconsistent results between test runs

**Root Causes**
- Color contrast calculations differ between environments
- Font rendering variations affecting measurements
- Timing-dependent content not fully loaded during testing
- Browser rendering engine differences

**Solutions**
```bash
# Local reproduction
npm run check:a11y:all  # Run full accessibility test suite locally
npm run build-storybook && npx test-storybook  # Test against static build
```

**Investigation Steps**
1. Check `test-results/junit.xml` for specific violation details
2. Compare local and CI color contrast calculations
3. Verify component rendering timing and loading states
4. Review accessibility configuration in `.storybook/test-runner.js`

### 2.3 Coverage JSON Format Issues

**Symptoms**
- CI reports malformed coverage JSON with leading commas
- Coverage parsing failures in CI pipeline
- Tests pass but coverage reports fail

**Root Causes**
- Jest coverage output format inconsistencies
- File system timing issues during coverage generation
- Incomplete coverage file writes

**Solutions**
```bash
# Local validation
npm run validate:coverage  # Check coverage file format
npm test -- --coverage    # Regenerate coverage files
```

**Prevention**
- Use coverage format validation in development workflow
- Implement coverage file validation in CI before processing
- Refer to `scripts/coverage/validate-coverage-format.js` for details

### 2.4 Dependency and Version Conflicts

**Symptoms**
- `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'storyStore')` errors
- Version mismatch warnings during installation
- Tests that pass locally but fail in CI

**Root Causes**
- Storybook version incompatibilities with test runner
- Package lock file synchronization issues
- Node.js version differences between local and CI

**Solutions**
```bash
# Verify versions locally
npm ls @storybook/test-runner
npm ls @storybook/react
node --version  # Should match CI version (Node 22)

# Fix common issues
npm ci  # Clean install matching package-lock.json
npm update @storybook/test-runner  # Update to compatible version
```

## 3. Debugging Procedures

### 3.1 Initial Diagnosis

**Step 1: Identify the Failure Point**
```bash
# Check CI logs for specific error location
# Common failure points:
# 1. Dependency installation
# 2. Storybook build
# 3. Server startup
# 4. Test execution
```

**Step 2: Collect Diagnostic Information**
```bash
# Available artifacts (uploaded automatically)
test-logs/a11y-test-output.log      # Test execution logs
test-logs/storybook-server-*.log    # Server startup logs
test-results/a11y-test-report.json  # Structured test results
test-results/junit.xml              # Detailed violation reports
```

**Step 3: Determine Environment Factors**
- Check if the issue is CI-specific by reproducing locally
- Verify Node.js version matches CI environment (Node 22)
- Ensure package-lock.json is synchronized

### 3.2 Server Startup Debugging

**Enable Debug Mode**
```bash
# In CI workflow (manual trigger)
workflow_dispatch -> debug: true

# Local debugging
DEBUG_CI=true node scripts/storybook/run-a11y-tests-ci.js
```

**Debug Output Analysis**
```bash
# Server startup diagnostics
node scripts/storybook/debug-ci-server.js

# Expected outputs:
# ‚úÖ Server ready at http://localhost:6006
# ‚úÖ Health check passed
# ‚úÖ Stories loaded: X stories found
```

**Common Server Issues**
- **Port conflicts**: Look for "EADDRINUSE" errors in logs
- **Build corruption**: Verify `storybook-static/index.html` exists and contains valid HTML
- **Resource exhaustion**: Check for memory or timeout-related errors

### 3.3 Test Execution Debugging

**Identify Specific Failing Stories**
```bash
# Parse junit.xml for detailed violation information
grep -A 10 -B 5 "accessibility violation" test-results/junit.xml

# Common violation patterns:
# - Color contrast failures
# - Missing ARIA labels
# - Invalid HTML structure
```

**Reproduce Locally**
```bash
# Test specific stories
npx test-storybook --stories="**/Button.stories.*"

# Test with CI-like conditions
NODE_ENV=production npm run build-storybook
npx test-storybook --url=http://localhost:6006
```

**Compare Local vs CI Results**
1. Run identical tests locally against static build
2. Check for environment-specific CSS or rendering differences
3. Verify accessibility configuration matches between environments

### 3.4 Log Analysis Techniques

**Server Logs Pattern Recognition**
```bash
# Successful startup pattern
[INFO] Server started successfully
[INFO] Health check passed
[INFO] Stories loaded: N stories

# Failure patterns
[ERROR] Port 6006 already in use
[ERROR] Build artifacts not found
[ERROR] Health check timeout
```

**Test Execution Logs**
```bash
# Success indicators
‚úÖ All accessibility tests passed
üìä Test summary: X passed, 0 failed

# Failure indicators
‚ùå X accessibility violations detected
‚ö†Ô∏è Tests completed with exit code 1
```

// In workflow
timeout-minutes: 15  // Overall job timeout
timeout-minutes: 10  // Storybook build timeout
timeout-minutes: 12  // Test execution timeout

// In scripts
TEST_TIMEOUT = 600000  // 10 minutes for CI test execution
HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT = 45000  // 45 seconds for server health check
```

## 5. Emergency Procedures

### 5.1 Critical CI Failures

**If All Tests Are Failing**
1. Check for recent dependency updates that may have introduced breaking changes
2. Verify Storybook build process completes successfully
3. Compare package-lock.json with last known working state
4. Roll back to previous working commit if necessary

**If Server Won't Start**
1. Enable debug mode: Set `DEBUG_CI=true` in workflow
2. Check for port conflicts or resource exhaustion
3. Verify build artifacts: `storybook-static/index.html` and `storybook-static/index.json`
4. Use manual workflow dispatch with debug enabled

### 5.2 Bypassing CI for Urgent Fixes

**Temporary Skip Options**
```bash
# Skip accessibility checks (emergency only)
A11Y_SKIP=1 npm run check:a11y:staged

# Modify workflow paths to avoid triggering
# (Edit .github/workflows/storybook-a11y.yml paths section)
```

**When to Use Emergency Procedures**
- Critical production fixes needed immediately
- Known accessibility issues being addressed separately
- Infrastructure problems preventing normal CI operation

**Recovery Steps**
1. Address the root cause of the CI failure
2. Remove any emergency bypass configurations
3. Verify all tests pass before re-enabling normal CI flow
4. Document the incident and prevention measures
