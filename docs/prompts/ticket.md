# GitPulse Refactoring Ticket

## Context
GitPulse has grown rapidly, and several key files have become too large and complex. This has led to maintainability issues and makes it difficult for the team to collaborate efficiently. The codebase now contains files that exceed our size limits (warning at 500 lines, error at 1000 lines).

## Objective
Refactor the largest files in the codebase, focusing on proper separation of concerns and modularization, while ensuring the application functionality remains unchanged.

## Requirements
1. Break down large files into smaller, focused modules
2. Ensure proper type definitions and interfaces
3. Extract reusable hooks and utility functions
4. Create well-defined UI component hierarchy
5. Maintain backward compatibility for API interfaces
6. Implement comprehensive tests for refactored components
7. Update documentation to reflect new architecture

## Acceptance Criteria
1. No files exceed 1000 lines of code
2. All refactored code passes existing tests
3. No new warnings or errors from ESLint or TypeScript
4. UI functionality remains identical to before refactoring
5. Documentation is updated to reflect new file structure
