# Debug Request

I need to debug an issue in the gitpulse application. The application is encountering a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error when running locally, indicating an infinite update loop.

## Bug Details

- Error: "Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render."
- The error originates from `handleRepositoryFetchSuccess` function at `useRepositoryFetching.useCallback[fetchRepositories]`
- The issue is related to state updates causing infinite re-renders

## Original Task ID

None identified in the current TODO.md file.

## Analysis Request

Please analyze the codebase to:

1. Identify where the `useRepositoryFetching` hook is defined
2. Examine how the `fetchRepositories` function is implemented in useCallback
3. Analyze the `handleRepositoryFetchSuccess` function to understand how state is being updated
4. Look for potential issues with dependency arrays in useEffect or useCallback hooks
5. Identify patterns that could lead to an infinite update loop
6. Suggest potential fixes based on best practices for React hooks

Focus on the components/hooks that might be responsible for this infinite loop, particularly looking at how state is updated and how dependency arrays are defined.
