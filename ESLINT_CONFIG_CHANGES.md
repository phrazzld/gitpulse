# ESLint Configuration Consolidation

This document explains the changes made to consolidate the ESLint configuration files as part of task T002.

## Changes Made

1. **Kept the flat config format (`eslint.config.mjs`)** as decided in task T001.

2. **Incorporated key Next.js rules**:

   - Added `jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid` rule configuration which is a key part of the Next.js core-web-vitals ruleset
   - This rule ensures proper use of the Next.js `Link` component
   - Note: Full Next.js plugin support in flat config requires additional setup that can be addressed in a future task

3. **Added Prettier compatibility**:

   - Configured `linterOptions` to ensure Prettier and ESLint work well together
   - Set `noInlineConfig: false` to allow inline ESLint comments
   - Set `reportUnusedDisableDirectives: true` to catch unnecessary ESLint disables

4. **Added test file overrides**:

   - Created a separate configuration section for test files
   - Relaxed certain rules for test files:
     - Allowed longer functions (`max-lines-per-function: off`)
     - Allowed more nested callbacks for describe/it blocks (`max-nested-callbacks: off`)
     - Kept `no-explicit-any` and `no-unused-vars` as warnings

5. **Enhanced TypeScript configuration**:

   - Added explicit reference to the TypeScript configuration file
   - Maintained all the recommended TypeScript ESLint rules

6. **Preserved all existing rules** from both configuration files:
   - React and React Hooks rules
   - Import rules
   - Accessibility (a11y) rules
   - TypeScript rules
   - ESLint comments rules
   - Standard JavaScript rules
   - File complexity rules

## Testing

The consolidated configuration has been tested to ensure it correctly enforces:

- React and Next.js best practices
- TypeScript type safety
- Code style and formatting
- Accessibility standards
- Project-specific conventions from the Development Philosophy

## Next Steps

1. Task T003: Remove the unused ESLint configuration file (`.eslintrc.js`)
2. Task T004: Change `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` rule to "error"
